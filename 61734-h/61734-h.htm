			<p>
			  It is probable that with the presentation of these, among the earliest
			  of the writings of William Sidney Porter (O. Henry), there is nothing
			  left to be added to the total of his work, and that they will close,
			  as they in a large measure opened the career of America’s greatest
			  short story writer.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Aside from the intrinsic merit in the newspaper writings of O. Henry
			  which are here given, they have the additional fascination of
			  disclosing to all who have read and know O. Henry from his maturer
			  work the budding of his genius, the first outcroppings of that style,
			  that vivid drawing of character, that keen sense of humor, and that
			  wondrous understanding of human nature which afterward marked him as
			  one of the world’s geniuses. It is as though one might go back and
			  watch with eyes that have seen its fullest development and matured
			  beauty, the forming and unfolding of a rose; as though one who has
			  listened to the plaudits of centuries might go back four hundred years
			  and see and study Raphael as he began to wield the brush which
			  subsequently wrought such wonderful magic.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Having a high appreciation of the genius of O. Henry, the compiler
			  took occasion while spending a year in Austin, Texas, where O. Henry
			  had lived, to ask his friends and neighbors about him. Among them was
			  Mr. Ed McLean, secretary to the railroad commission, a personal friend
			  of O. Henry’s, who told her about the column O. Henry had conducted on
			  the Houston <i>Post</i>. He thought O. Henry must have worked for the
			  <i>Post</i> some time in the latter part of 1896 to the fall of 1897.
			</p>

			<p>
			  A visit to the Houston <i>Post</i> office and a search through the
			  files of that period were without results. But a call on Mr. A. E.
			  Clarkson, who was with the <i>Post</i> then and who is now business
			  manager of the <i>Post</i>, was more successful. Mr. Clarkson looked
			  up the old records in the business office, showing when O. Henry
			  received pay checks, which served as a guide to pages of a year
			  earlier, where the altogether distinctive touch of O. Henry proved
			  that the goal was reached. Here was found the same discernment, the
			  same insight, the same humor, the same style which runs through all
			  his work like a marked thread interwoven into a rare fabric. In many
			  of the brief paragraphs and short stories were found the idioplasm
			  which in the rich soil of his fuller experience grew into some of the
			  masterpieces of his later life.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Thus in the files of the Houston <i>Post</i> of the period between
			  October 18, 1895, and June 22, 1896, were found the writings which
			  make up this volume. It was characteristic of O. Henry’s modesty that
			  these were unsigned. They are published as they originally appeared in
			  “Tales of the Town,” “Postscripts and Pencillings,” and “Some
			  Postscripts,” under which titles O. Henry wrote at different times
			  during his association with the <i>Post</i>.
			</p>

			<p>
			  But the rediscovery of this work was not enough. To identify it as
			  beyond question of doubt as that of O. Henry was imperative. To have
			  offered these writings with less of precaution would have savored of
			  literary vandalism, if not sacrilege. This identification has been
			  made, and its sources are herewith given the reader as a part of the
			  introduction of this volume.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Here is an account by Mr. R. M. Johnston, who formerly controlled the
			  Houston <i>Post</i>, of how he gave O. Henry the job in which he was
			  first to demonstrate his remarkable story-telling gifts:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="letter">
				<p class="dateline">Houston, Texas, October 21, 1922.</p>
				<p class="recipient">Miss Florence Stratton,<br/>Beaumont, Texas.</p>
				<p class="salutation">My dear Miss Stratton:</p>

				<p>
				  You asked me to write some incidents of O. Henry’s
				  connection with the Houston <i>Post</i> when I controlled
				  that newspaper and I am glad to comply with your request.
				</p>

				<p> The first thing I ever heard of Mr. Porter, whose
				writing name was O. Henry, was when some one sent me a copy
				of the little publication, “The Rolling Stone,” published in
				Austin. This was sent me by Mr. Ed McLean, Secretary of the
				Railroad Commission, a mutual friend of Mr. Porter and
				myself. Mr. McLean made the suggestion that Porter would be
				worth considering for a place as a writer on the
				<i>Post</i>. After reading <i>The Rolling Stone</i> I made
				an appointment through Mr. McLean with Mr. Porter, who was
				at that time an employe of one of the banks at Austin.
				Subsequently I met him and made a contract with him to join
				the <i>Post</i> editorial staff which he did in a short
				time. While on the paper his duties were somewhat of a
				varied nature. He had, however, a column on the editorial
				page daily filled with witticism, quaint little stories,
				etc. He also did some special assignment work in a very
				magnificent way.
				</p>

				<p> One morning while sitting at my desk he came to my
				office in his usual quiet, dignified way and laid a piece of
				cardboard on my table with the remark, “I don’t suppose you
				will want this, but I thought I would let you look at it,”
				and he walked out. After he had gone, I picked up the
				cardboard and found it was an unusual cartoon. I was so
				struck with it that I took it to his room and remarked,
				“Porter, did you do this?” He looked up with a faint smile,
				and said “Yes.” I said to him that I did not know that he
				was a cartoonist, and his reply was that he did that kind of
				work for his own amusement at odd times.
				</p>

				<p> To make a long story short, we were in the midst of a
				very warm political campaign in Texas and during the
				campaign he drew some of the most magnificent cartoons that
				I have ever seen in print anywhere. They attracted
				attention, not only in Texas, but were copied freely
				throughout the United States.
				</p>

				<p> Mr. Porter was a lovely character and one of the
				brightest men that I have ever come in contact with. He was
				modest, almost to the fault of self-effacement. His leaving
				the Houston <i>Post</i> was an irretrievable loss to the
				paper, but the means possibly of developing the greatest
				short story writer of this or any other age.
				</p>

				<p class="salutation">My dear Miss Stratton:</p>

				<p>
				  In the first years of my employment by the Houston
				  <i>Post</i>, O. Henry, whose name was Sidney Porter, was a
				  member of the <i>Post</i> staff. As is well known, Mr.
				  Porter began his daily journalistic work as a special
				  feature writer for the Houston <i>Post</i> and the human
				  interest and literary attractiveness of his writings were
				  a source of delight to Texas readers.
				</p>

				<p> I enjoyed my acquaintance and association with Mr.
				Porter while a youth in the business office of the Houston
				<i>Post</i> and not only the stories that he would write,
				but those he would tell me, made a deep impression on my
				mind.
				</p>

				<p> Mr. Porter’s work was that of publishing a special
				feature column, “Some Postscripts and Pencillings” on the
				editorial page of the <i>Post</i> during 1895–96, and I
				think a reproduction of his daily writings in that column,
				which then were followed by the readers of the Texas
				newspaper readers of the nation.

				<p>
				  In reply to your letter of October 15, I find that Mr.
				  Porter, afterward known as O. Henry, was on the payroll of
				  the Houston <i>Post</i> from October 1895 to June 1896.
				</p>

				<p> During that time Mr. Porter wrote, and there was
				published from time to time in the columns of the
				<i>Post</i> various articles headed “Some Postscripts” and
				“Postscripts and Pencillings.”
				</p>

				<p> The writer was also connected with the <i>Post</i>
				during this period, being in the business office. He was
				personally acquainted with Mr. Porter and knows of his own
				knowledge that the articles headed as stated above were
				written by him.

			  Neither the compilation, verification, nor publication of these
			  newspaper writings of O. Henry would have been possible without the
			  co-operation of Mr. Roy G. Watson, present proprietor and publisher of
			  the Houston <i>Post</i>, whose consent for their publication has been
			  generously given; and of Governor William P. Hobby, Colonel R. M.
			  Johnston, and Mr. A. E. Clarkson, all associated with the <i>Post</i>
			  during O. Henry’s employment, and to these, whose attestation of
			  authenticity of this work is herewith given, the compiler is grateful.
			  The doing of this work has been a labor of love, and if the result is
			  to add to the luster of O. Henry’s name the writer shall have been
			  repaid.

			<p>
			  No pen is so facile as to add to or detract from the fame of William
			  Sidney Porter. The flame of his genius has been extinguished, but what
			  he wrought in a vast understanding of humanity will ever illuminate
			  American literature.

			<p>
				<i>With respect to O. Henry’s services, the Houston Post states as
				follows:</i>
			</p>

			<p>
			  Between musty covers of the <i>Post</i> files from October, 1895, to
			  July, 1896, are cross-sections of life drawn by a master artist;
			  vignettes as perfect and as beautiful as the finest Amsterdam diamond.
			  Only they are comparatively unknown because they have been
			  overshadowed by larger and more brilliant creations of the same master
			  hand.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Verses beautiful and appealing; description, touched by wonderful
			  imagery; dialogue, the lines of which sparkle with wit and
			  understanding of human frailties!
			</p>

			<p>
			  They make up O. Henry’s “Tales of the Town,” his “Postscripts and
			  Pencillings,” and his “Some Postscripts.” Save for the publication for
			  a brief space of <i>The Rolling Stone</i>, a rollicking sheet that was
			  issued irregularly over the period of several months, they represent
			  the sum total of O. Henry’s newspaper writings.
			</p>

			<p>
			  All too brief to suit lovers of O. Henry’s work, they nevertheless
			  betray the writer’s knack of getting at the heart and mind of his
			  fellow beings. They show him as well acquainted with the newsdealer on
			  the corner as with his favorite hotel clerk; as much at home in
			  talking with a puncher from the Panhandle as in conversing with a
			  drummer from St. Louis. Into them the master of the short story
			  managed to crowd uncanny description, insight into human nature, and
			  the highly dramatic.
			</p>

			<p>
			  O. Henry came to the <i>Post</i> at the invitation of its editor and
			  his first column appeared in the <i>Post</i> on October 18th entitled
			  “Tales of the Town.” The caption soon changed to “Postscripts and
			  Pencillings” and later still to “Some Postscripts.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Some days a column of seven-point! Others only half a column. Still
			  others when “Some Postscripts” failed to appear at all.
			</p>

			<p>
			  But always, whatever the quantity, the quality of O. Henry’s output
			  remained at high level.
			</p>

			<p>
			  As in the later days in New York, O. Henry was exceedingly modest and
			  shy. He “took a little getting acquainted with” according to tradition
			  handed down. A quiet, unassuming chap, with eyes which seemingly saw
			  little and yet took in everything, the new member of the staff soon
			  acquired a reputation of being the best listener in town. In addition,
			  he was a painstakingly accurate reporter and observer.
			</p>

			<p>
			  O. Henry came to the <i>Post</i> under his real name of Sidney Porter,
			  but it was as “The Post Man” that he referred to himself in his
			  writings. The pronoun “I” seldom appeared.
			</p>

			<p>
			  According to friends, O. Henry, or Sidney Porter, possessed the most
			  valuable trick of the interviewer. When the telling of a story lagged
			  momentarily, he would insert just the right question in just the right
			  place. And this show of interest never failed to stimulate the teller
			  to a fresh spurt.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Favorite haunts in Houston were the lobby of the old Hutchins House,
			  the Grand Central Depot, and the street corners. He used to sit for
			  hours in the hotel, his eyes playing over the faces of guests. Mayhap
			  he was studying types, who knows? Certain, though, it is that hotel
			  attaches grew to love the author of “Some Postscripts,” and they
			  frequently went out of their way to send him word of stories on the
			  old hotel’s ancient register.
			</p>

			<p>
			  At the Grand Central Depot—Grand Central then as now—“The Post Man”
			  was loved by all who knew him. From station master to porter, from
			  superintendent to telegraph operator, the writer of “Some Postscripts”
			  got help and inspiration for many of his brilliant anecdotes and human
			  interest stories.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Then, as later in New York, it was the man in the street who claimed
			  his chief attention. Feted though he was by some who thought to
			  patronize him, “The Post Man” refused to allow his head to be turned
			  by admiration. He continued the even tenor of his way, writing the
			  things which most appealed to him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Abundant and spontaneous as was O. Henry’s literary output, his jokes
			  were never barbed. There is no record of anyone ever coming to the
			  <i>Post</i> editorial room to “lick” the author of “Some Postscripts.”
			  Rather there came to him many picturesque figures of the Southwest,
			  eager to make the acquaintance of the rising young “colyumist.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  At a time when bicycles and bloomers were agitating the news writers
			  of the country, O. Henry took delight in caricaturing the customs. His
			  sketches of bloomered, career-seeking women and timid husbands are at
			  once a delight and a revelation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  O. Henry’s brilliant style, together with his never-flagging wit and
			  his seemingly inexhaustible fund of anecdote quickly captured his
			  contemporaries among Texas newspaper men. “The man, woman, or child,”
			  wrote an exchange in 1896, “who pens ‘Some Postscripts’ in the Houston
			  <i>Post</i>, is a weird genius, and ought to be captured and put on
			  exhibition.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  It was soon after this that O. Henry was advised to go to New York,
			  where his ability would command a higher remuneration. But after
			  making all preparations to try his wings in the great metropolis, Fate
			  intervened and O. Henry went instead to South America.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The last columns of O. Henry’s brilliant paragraphs appeared in the
			  <i>Post</i> of June 22, 1896.

			  The sun is shining brightly, and the birds are singing merrily in the
			  trees! All nature wears an aspect of peace and harmony. On the porch
			  of a little hotel in a neighboring county a stranger is sitting on a
			  bench waiting for the train, quietly smoking his pipe.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Presently a tall man wearing boots and a slouch hat, steps to the door
			  of the hotel from the inside with a six-shooter in his hand and fires.
			  The man on the bench rolls over with a loud yell as the bullet grazes
			  his ear. He springs to his feet in amazement and wrath and shouts:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What are you shooting at me for?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The tall man advances with his slouch hat in his hand, bows and says:
			  “Beg pardon, sah. I am Colonel Jay, sah, and I understood you to
			  insult me, sah, but I see I was mistaken. Am very glad I did not kill
			  you, sah.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I insult you—how?” inquires the stranger. “I never said a word.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You tapped on the bench, sah, as much as to say you was a woodpeckah,
			  sah, and I belong to the other faction. I see now that you was only
			  knockin’ the ashes from you’ pipe, sah. I ask yo’ pahdon, and that you
			  will come in and have a drink with me, sah, to show that you do not
			  harbor any ill feeling after a gentleman apologizes to you, sah.”

			  and their language abounds in figures, metaphors, and parables, and
			  ample evidence is given of the mental ability of the inhabitants.”

			  There is an item going the rounds of the press relative to the
			  well-known curiosity of woman. It states that if a man brings a
			  newspaper home out of which a piece has been clipped his wife will
			  never rest until she has procured another paper to see what it was
			  that had been cut out.
			</p>

			<p>
			  A Houston man was quite impressed with the idea, so he resolved to
			  make the experiment. One night last week he cut out of the day’s paper
			  a little two-inch catarrh cure advertisement, and left the mutilated
			  paper on the table where his wife would be sure to read it.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He picked up a book and pretended to be interested, while he watched
			  her glance over the paper. When she struck the place where the piece
			  had been cut, she frowned and seemed to be thinking very seriously.
			</p>

			<p>
			  However, she did not say anything about it and the man was in doubt as
			  to whether her curiosity had been aroused or not.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The next day when he came home to dinner she met him at the door with
			  flashing eyes and an ominous look about her jaw.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You miserable, deceitful wretch!” she cried. “After living all these
			  years with you to find that you have been basely deceiving me and
			  leading a double life, and bringing shame and sorrow upon your
			  innocent family! I always thought you were a villain and a reprobate,
			  and now I have positive proof of the fact.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Wh—wha—what do you mean, Maria?” he gasped. “I haven’t been doing
			  anything.”

			  Since you pretend not to understand me—look at this.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  She held up to his gaze a complete paper of the issue of the day
			  before.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You thought to hide your actions from me by cutting out part of the
			  paper, but I was too sharp for you.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Why that was just a little joke, Maria. I didn’t think you would take
			  it seriously. I—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Do you call that a joke, you shameless wretch?” she cried, spreading
			  the paper before him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The man looked and read in dismay. In cutting out the catarrh
			  advertisement he had never thought to see what was on the other side
			  of it, and this was the item that appeared, to one reading the other
			  side of the page, to have been clipped:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
				  A gentleman about town, who stands well in business
				  circles, had a high old time last night in a certain
				  restaurant where he entertained at supper a couple of
				  chorus ladies belonging to the comic opera company now in
				  the city. Loud talking and breaking of dishes attracted
				  some attention, but the matter was smoothed over, owing to
				  the prominence of the gentleman referred to.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  “You call that a joke, do you, you old reptile,” shrieked the excited
			  lady. “I’m going home to mamma this evening and I’m going to stay
			  there. Thought you’d fool me by cutting it out, did you? You sneaking,
			  dissipated old snake you! I’ve got my trunk nicely packed and I’m
			  going straight home—don’t you come near me!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Maria,” gasped the bewildered man. “I swear I—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Don’t add perjury to your crimes, sir!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The man tried unsuccessfully to speak three or four times, and then
			  grabbed his hat and ran downtown. Fifteen minutes later he came back
			  bringing two new silk dress patterns, four pounds of caramels, and his
			  bookkeeper and three clerks to prove that he was hard at work in the
			  store on the night in question.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The affair was finally settled satisfactorily, but there is one
			  Houston man who has no further curiosity about woman’s curiosity.

			</p>

			<p>
			  “I saw the corpse, sir, but found it impossible to write a description
			  of the affair.”
			</p>

			<p>

			<p>
			  One night last week in San Antonio a tall, solemn-looking man, wearing
			  a silk hat, walked into a hotel bar from the office, and stood by the
			  stove where a group of men were sitting smoking and talking. A fat
			  man, who noticed him go in, asked the hotel clerk who it was. The
			  clerk told his name and the fat man followed the stranger into the
			  barroom, casting at him glances of admiration and delight.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Pretty cold night, gentlemen, for a warm country,” said the man in
			  the silk hat.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Oh—ha—ha—ha—ha—ha!” yelled the fat man, bursting into a loud laugh.
			  “That’s pretty good.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The solemn man looked surprised and went on warming himself at the
			  stove.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Presently one of the men sitting by the stove said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “That old Turkey over in Europe doesn’t seem to be making much noise
			  now.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No,” said the solemn man, “it seems like the other nations are doing
			  all the gobbling.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The fat man let out a yell and laid down and rolled over and over on
			  the floor. “Gosh ding it,” he howled, “that’s the best thing I ever
			  heard. Ah—ha—ha—ha—ha—ha! Come on, gentlemen, and have something on
			  that.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The invitation seemed to all hands to be a sufficient apology for all
			  his ill-timed merriment, and they ranged along the bar. While the
			  drinks were being prepared, the fat man slipped along the line and
			  whispered something in the ear of everyone, except the man with the
			  silk hat. When he got through a broad smile spread over the faces of
			  the crowd.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Well, gentlemen, here’s fun!” said the solemn man as he raised his
			  glass.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The whole party, with one accord, started off into a perfect roar of
			  laughter, spilling half their drinks on the bar and floor.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Did you ever hear such a flow of wit?” said one.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Chock full of fun, ain’t he?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Same old fellow he used to be.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Best thing that’s been got off here in a year.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Gentlemen,” said the solemn man, “there seems to be a conspiracy
			  among you to guy me. I like a joke myself, but I like to know what I’m
			  being hurrahed about.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Three men lay down in the sawdust and screamed, and the rest fell in
			  chairs and leaned against the bar in paroxysms of laughter. Then three
			  or four of them almost fought for the honor of setting them up again.
			  The solemn man was suspicious and watchful, but he drank every time
			  anyone proposed to treat. Whenever he made a remark, the whole gang
			  would yell with laughter until the tears ran from their eyes.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Well,” said the solemn man, after about twenty rounds had been paid
			  for by the others, “the best of friends must part. I’ve got to get to
			  my downy couch.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Good!” yelled the fat man. “Ha—ha—ha—ha—ha! ‘Downy couch’ is good.
			  Best thing I ever heard. You are as good, by Gad, as you ever were.
			  Never heard such impromptu wit. Texas is proud of you, old boy.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Good night, gentlemen,” said the solemn man. “I’ve got to get up
			  early in the morning and go to work.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Hear that!” shouted the fat man. “Says he’s got to work.
			  Ha—ha—ha—ha—ha!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The whole crowd gave a parting roar of laughter as the solemn man
			  walked to the door. He stopped for a moment and said: “Had a very
			  (hic) pleasant evening (hic) gents. Hope’ll shee you (hic) ’n mornin’.
			  Here’sh my card. Goo’ night.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The fat man seized the card and shook the solemn man’s hand. When he
			  had gone, he glanced at the card, and his face took on a serious
			  frown.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Gentlemen,” he said, “you all know who our friend is that we have been
			  entertaining, don’t you?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Of course; you said it was Alex Sweet, the ‘Texas Siftings’ man.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “So I understood,” said the fat man. “The hotel clerk said it was Alex
			  Sweet.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  He handed them the card and skipped out the side door. The card read:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="card">
				<p>L. X. Wheat</p>
				<p>Representing Kansas City</p>
				<p>Smith and Jones Mo.</p>
				<p>Wholesale Undertakers’ Supplies</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  The crowd was out $32 on treats, and they armed themselves and are
			  laying for the fat man. When a stranger attempts to be funny in San
			  Antonio now, he has to produce proper credentials in writing before he
			  can raise a smile.

			<p>
			  The other day a Houston man died and left a young and charming widow
			  to mourn his loss. Just before the funeral, the pastor came around to
			  speak what words of comfort he could, and learn her wishes regarding
			  the obsequies. He found her dressed in a becoming mourning costume,
			  sitting with her chin in her hand, gazing with far-off eyes in an
			  unfathomable sea of retrospection.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The pastor approached her gently, and said: “Pardon me for intruding
			  upon your grief, but I wish to know whether you prefer to have a
			  funeral sermon preached, or simply to have the service read.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The heartbroken widow scarcely divined his meaning, so deeply was she
			  plunged in her sorrowful thoughts, but she caught some of his words,
			  and answered brokenly:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Oh, red, of course. Red harmonizes so well with black.”

			<p>
			  It is a busy scene in the rear of one of Houston’s greatest
			  manufacturing establishments. A number of workmen are busy raising
			  some heavy object by means of blocks and tackles. Somehow, a rope is
			  worn in two by friction, and a derrick falls. There is a hurried
			  scrambling out of the way, a loud jarring crash, a cloud of dust, and
			  a man stretched out dead beneath the heavy timbers.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The others gather round and with herculean efforts drag the beams from
			  across his mangled form. There is a hoarse murmur of pity from rough
			  but kindly breasts, and the question runs around the group, “Who is to
			  tell her?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  In a neat little cottage near the railroad, within their sight as they
			  stand, a bright-eyed, brownhaired young woman is singing at her work,
			  not knowing that death has snatched away her husband in the twinkling
			  of an eye.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Singing happily at her work, while the hand that she had chosen to
			  protect and comfort her through life lies stilled and fast turning to
			  the coldness of the grave!
			</p>

			<p>
			  These rough men shrink like children from telling her. They dread to
			  bear the news that will change her smiles to awful sorrow and
			  lamentation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You go, Mike,” three or four of them say at once. “ ’Tis more lamin’
			  ye have than any av us, whatever, and ye’ll be afther brakin’ the news
			  to her as aisy as ye can. Be off wid ye now, and shpake gently to
			  Tim’s poor lassie while we thry to get the corpse in shape.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Mike is a pleasant-faced man, young and stalwart, and with a last look
			  at his unfortunate comrade he goes slowly down the street toward the
			  cottage where the fair young wife—alas, now a widow—lives.
			</p>

			<p>
			  When he arrives, he does not hesitate. He is tenderhearted, but
			  strong. He lifts the gate latch and walks firmly to the door. There is
			  something in his face, before he speaks, that tells her the truth.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What was it?” she asks, “spontaneous combustion or snakes?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Derrick fell,” says Mike.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Then I’ve lost my bet,” she says. “I thought sure it would be
			  whisky.”

			  A strong scent of onions and the kind of whisky advertised “for
			  mechanical purposes” came through the keyhole, closely followed by an
			  individual bearing a bulky manuscript under his arm about the size of
			  a roll of wall paper.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The individual was of the description referred to by our English
			  cousins as “one of the lower classes,” and by Populist papers as “the
			  bone and sinew of the country,” and the scene of his invasion was the
			  sanctum of a great Texas weekly newspaper.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The editor sat at his desk with his hands clenched in his scanty hair,
			  gazing despairingly at a typewritten letter from the house where he
			  bought his paper supply.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The individual drew a chair close to the editor and laid the heavy
			  manuscript upon the desk, which creaked beneath its weight.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I’ve worked nineteen hours upon it,” he said, “but it’s done at
			  last.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What is it?” asked the editor, “a lawn mower?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It is an answer, sir, to the President’s message: a refutation of
			  each and every one of his damnable doctrines, a complete and scathing
			  review of every assertion and every false insidious theory that he has
			  advanced.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “About how many—er—how many pounds do you think it contains?” said the
			  editor thoughtfully.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Five hundred and twenty-seven pages, sir, and—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Written in pencil on one side of the paper?” asked the editor, with a
			  strange light shining in his eye.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes, and it treats of—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You can leave it,” said the editor, rising from his chair. “I have no
			  doubt I can use it to advantage.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The individual, with a strong effort, collected his breath and
			  departed, feeling that a fatal blow had been struck at those in high
			  places.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Ten minutes later six india-rubber erasers had been purchased, and the
			  entire office force were at work upon the manuscript.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The great weekly came out on time, but the editor gazed pensively at
			  his last month’s unreceipted paper bill and said:
			</p>

			  “So far, so good; but I wonder what we will print on next week!”

			  He was old and feeble and his sands of life were nearly run out. He
			  walked with faltering steps along one of the most fashionable avenues
			  in the city of Houston. He had left the city twenty years ago, when it
			  was little more than a thriving village, and now, weary of wandering
			  through the world and filled with an unutterable longing to rest his
			  eyes once more upon the scenes of his youth, he had come back to find
			  a bustling modern city covering the site of his former home. He sought
			  in vain for some familiar object, some old time sight that would
			  recall memories of bygone days. All had changed. On the site where his
			  father’s cottage had stood, a stately mansion reared its walls; the
			  vacant lot where he had played when a boy, was covered with modern
			  buildings. Magnificent lawns stretched on either hand, running back to
			  palatial dwellings. Not one of the sights of his boyhood days was
			  left.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Suddenly, with a glad cry, he rushed forward with renewed vigor. He
			  saw before him, untouched by the hand of man and unchanged by time, an
			  old familiar object around which he had played when a child. He
			  reached out his arms and ran toward it with a deep sigh of
			  satisfaction.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Later on they found him asleep, with a peaceful smile on his face,
			  lying on the old garbage pile in the middle of the street, the sole
			  relic of his boyhood’s recollections.

			  He had a birthday last Tuesday and she sent him a beautiful bound and

			  among piano agents than any other class of men. The insurance and
			  fruit tree businesses are mild and retiring in comparison with the
			  piano industry. The Houston man, who is a prominent lawyer, knew this,
			  and he was careful not to tell too many people of his intentions, for
			  fear the agents would annoy him. He inquired in a music store only
			  once, regarding prices, etc., and intended after a week or so to make
			  his selection.
			</p>

			<p>
			  When he left the store he went around by the post-office before going
			  back to work.
			</p>

			<p>
			  When he reached his office he found three agents perched on his desk
			  and in his chair waiting for him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  One of them got his mouth open first, and said: “Hear you want to buy
			  a piano, sir. For sweetness, durability, finish, tone, workmanship,
			  style, and quality the Steingay is—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Nixy,” said another agent, pushing in between them and seizing the
			  lawyer’s collar. “You get a Chitterling. Only piano in the world. For
			  sweetness, durability, finish, tone, workmanship—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Excuse me,” said the third agent. “I can’t stand by and see a man
			  swindled. The Chronic and Bark piano, for sweetness, durability,
			  finish—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Get out, every one of you,” shouted the lawyer. “When I want a piano
			  I’ll buy the one I please. Get out of the room!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The agents left, and the lawyer went to work on a brief. During the
			  afternoon, five of his personal friends called to recommend different
			  makes of pianos, and the lawyer began to get snappish.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He went out and got a drink and the bartender said: “Say, gent, me
			  brudder works in a piano factory and he gimme de tip dat you’se wants
			  to buy one of de tum-tums. Me brudder says dat for sweetness,
			  durability, finish—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Devil take your brother,” said the lawyer.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He got on the street car to go home and four agents were already
			  aboard waiting for him. He dodged back before they saw him and stood
			  on the platform. Presently the brakeman leaned over and whispered in
			  his ear:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Frien’, the Epperson piano what me uncle handles in East Texas, fur
			  sweetness, durability—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Stop the car,” said the lawyer. He got off and skulked in a dark
			  doorway until the four agents, who had also got off the car, rushed
			  past, and then he picked up a big stone from the gutter and put it in
			  his pocket. He went around a back way to his home and slipped up to
			  the gate feeling pretty safe.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The minister of his church had been calling at the house, and came out
			  the gate just as the lawyer reached it. The lawyer was the proud
			  father of a brand-new, two-weeks-old baby, and the minister had just
			  been admiring it, and wanted to congratulate him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “My dear brother,” said the minister. “Your house will soon be filled
			  with joy and music. I think it will be a great addition to your life.
			  Now, there is nothing in the world that for sweetness—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Confound you, you’re drumming for a piano, too, are you?” yelled the
			  lawyer, drawing the stone from his pocket. He fired away and knocked
			  the minister’s tall hat across the street, and kicked him in the shin.
			  The minister believed in the church militant, and he gave the lawyer a
			  one-two on the nose, and they clinched and rolled off the sidewalk on
			  a pile of loose bricks. The neighbors heard the row and came out with
			  shotguns and lanterns, and finally an understanding was arrived at.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The lawyer was considerably battered up, and the family doctor was
			  sent for to patch him. As the doctor bent over him with
			  sticking-plaster and a bottle of arnica, he said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You’ll be out in a day or two, and then I want you to come around and
			  buy a piano from my brother. The one he is agent for is acknowledged
			  to be the best one for sweetness, durability, style, quality, and
			  action in the world.”

			<p>
			  Young Lieutenant Baldwin burst excitedly into his general’s room and
			  cried hoarsely: “For God’s sake, General! Up! Up! and come. Spotted
			  Lightning has carried off your daughter, Inez!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  General Splasher sprang to his feet in dismay. “What,” he cried, “not
			  Spotted Lightning, the chief of the Kiomas, the most peaceful tribe in
			  the reservation?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “The same.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Good heavens! You know what this tribe is when aroused?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The lieutenant cast a swift look of intelligence at his commander.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “They are the most revengeful, murderous, and vindictive Indians in
			  the West when on the warpath, but for months they have been the most
			  peaceable,” he answered.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Come,” said the general, “we have not a moment to lose. What has been
			  done?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “There are fifty cavalrymen ready to start, with Bowie Knife Bill, the
			  famous scout, to track them.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Ten minutes later the general and the lieutenant, with Bowie Knife
			  Bill at their side, set out at a swinging gallop at the head of the
			  cavalry column.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Bowie Knife Bill, with the trained instincts of a border sleuthhound,
			  followed the trail of Spotted Lightning’s horse with unerring
			  swiftness.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Pray God we may not be too late,” said the general as he spurred his
			  panting steed—“and Spotted Lightning, too, of all the chiefs! He has
			  always seemed to be our friend.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “On, on,” cried Lieutenant Baldwin, “there may yet be time.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Mile after mile the pursuers covered, pausing not for food or water,
			  until nearly sunset.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Bowie Knife Bill pointed to a thin column of smoke in the distance and
			  said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Thar’s the varmints’ camp.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The hearts of all the men bounded with excitement as they neared the
			  spot.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Are we in time?” was the silent question in the mind of each.
			</p>

			<p>
			  They dashed into an open space of prairie and drew rein near Spotted
			  Lightning’s tent. The flap was closed. The troopers swung themselves
			  from their horses.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “If it is as I fear,” muttered the general hoarsely to the lieutenant,
			  “it means war with the Kioma nation. Oh, why did he not take some
			  other instead of my daughter?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  At that instance the door of the tent opened and Inez Splasher, the
			  general’s daughter, a maiden of about thirty-seven summers, emerged,
			  bearing in her hand the gory scalp of Spotted Lightning.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Too late!” cried the general as he fell senseless from his horse.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I knew it,” said Bowie Knife Bill, folding his arms with a silent
			  smile, “but what surprises me is how he ever got this far alive.”

			<p>
			  Houston is the dwelling place of a certain young lady who is
			  exceptionally blessed with the gifts of the goddess of fortune. She is
			  very fair to look upon, bright, witty, and possesses that gracious
			  charm so difficult to describe, but so potent to please, that is
			  commonly called personal magnetism. Although cast in such a lonely
			  world, and endowed with so many graces of mind and matter, she is no
			  idle butterfly of fashion, and the adulation she receives from a
			  numerous circle of admirers has not turned her head.
			</p>

			<p>
			  She has a close friend, a young lady of plain exterior, but a sensible
			  and practical mind, whom she habitually consults as a wise counselor
			  and advisor concerning the intricate problems of life.
			</p>

			<p>
			  One day she said to Marian—the wise friend: “How I wish there was some
			  way to find out who among these flattering suitors of mine is sincere
			  and genuine in the compliments that are paid me. Men are such
			  deceivers, and they all give me such unstinted praise, and make such
			  pretty speeches to me, that I do not know who among them, if any, are
			  true and sincere in their regard.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I will tell you a way,” said Marian. “The next evening when there are
			  a number of them calling upon you, recite a dramatic poem, and then
			  tell me how each one expresses his opinion of your effort.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The young lady was much impressed with the idea, and on the following
			  Friday evening when some half-dozen young men were in the parlor
			  paying her attentions, she volunteered to recite. She has not the
			  least dramatic talent, but she stood up and went through with a long
			  poem, with many gestures and much rolling of eyes and pressing of her
			  hands to her heart. She did it very badly, and without the least
			  regard for the rules of elocution or expression.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Later on, her friend Marian asked her how her effort was received.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Oh,” she said, “they all crowded around me, and appeared to be filled
			  with the utmost delight. Tom, and Henry, and Jim, and Charlie were in
			  raptures. They said that Mary Anderson could not have equaled it. They
			  said they had never heard anything spoken with such dramatic effect
			  and feeling.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Everyone praised you?” asked Marian.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “All but one. Mr. Judson sat back in his chair and never applauded at
			  all. He told me after I had finished that he was afraid I had very
			  little dramatic talent at all.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Now,” said Marian. “You know who is sincere and genuine?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes,” said the beautiful girl, with eyes shining with enthusiasm.
			  “The test was a complete success. I detest that odious Judson, and I’m
			  going to begin studying for the stage right away.”

			  An old man with long white chin whiskers and a derby hat two sizes
			  small, dropped into a Main Street drug store yesterday and beckoned a
			  clerk over into a corner. He was about sixty-five years old, but he
			  wore a bright red necktie, and was trying to smoke a very bad and
			  strong cigar in as offhand a style as possible.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Young man,” he said, “you lemme ask you a few questions, and I’ll
			  send you a big watermelon up from the farm next summer. I came to
			  Houston to see this here carnival, and do some tradin’. Right now,
			  before I go any further, have you got any hair dye?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Plenty of it.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Any of this real black shiny dye that looks blue in the sunshine?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “All right then, now I’ll proceed. Do you know anything about this
			  here Monroe docterin’?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Well, yes, something.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “And widders; do you feel able to prognosticate a few lines about
			  widders?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I can’t tell what you are driving at,” said the clerk. “What is it
			  you want to know?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I’m gettin’ to the pint. Now there’s hair dye, Monroe docterin’, and
			  widders. Got them all down in your mind?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes, but—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Jest hold on, now, and I’ll explain. There’s the unhappiest fat and
			  sassy widder moved into the adjinin’ farm to me, you ever see, and if
			  I knows the female heart she has cast eyes of longin’ upon yours
			  truly. Now if I dyes these here white whiskers I ketches her. By
			  blackin’ said whiskers and insertin’ say four fingers of rye where it
			  properly belongs, I kicks up my heels and I waltzes up and salutes the
			  widder like a calf of forty.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Well,” said the clerk, “our hair dye is—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Wait a minute, young feller. Now on the other hand I hears rumors of
			  wars this mornin’, and I hears alarmin’ talk about this here Monroe
			  docterin’. Ef I uses hair dye and trains down to thirty-eight or forty
			  years of age, I ketches the widder, but I turns into a peart and
			  chipper youth what is liable to be made to fight in this here great
			  war. Ef I gives up the hair dye, the recrutin’ sargent salutes these
			  white hairs and passes by, but I am takin’ big chances on the widder.
			  She has been to meetin’ twicet with a man what has been divorced, and
			  ties his own cree-vat, and this here Monroe docterin’ is all what
			  keeps me from pulling out seventy-five cents and makin’ a strong play
			  with said dye. What would you do, ef you was me, young feller?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I don’t think there will be any war soon,” said the clerk.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Jerusalem; I’m glad to hear it! Gimme the biggest bottle of
			  blue-black hair dye fur seventy-five cents that you got. I’m goin’ to
			  purpose to that widder before it gets dry, and risk the chances of
			  Monroe takin’ water again on this war business.”

			  not like to obtrude my grief upon the passersby. I have a little
			  daughter, sir; five years of age, with curly golden hair. Her name is
			  Lilian. She says to me this morning: ‘Papa, will Santa Claus bring me
			  a red wagon for Christmas?’ It completely unmanned me, sir, as, alas,
			  I am out of work and penniless. Just think, one little red wagon would
			  bring her happiness, and there are children who have hundreds of red
			  wagons.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Before you go out,” said the proprietor, “which you are going to do
			  in about fifteen seconds, I am willing to inform you that I have a
			  branch store on Trains Street, and was around there yesterday. You
			  came in and made the same talk about your little girl, whom you called
			  Daisy, and I gave you a wagon. It seems you don’t remember your little
			  girl’s name very well.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The man drew himself up with dignity, and started for the door. When
			  nearly there, he turned and said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Her name is Lilian Daisy, sir, and the wagon you gave me had a
			  rickety wheel and some of the paint was scratched off the handle. I
			  have a friend who tends bar on Willow Street, who is keeping it for me
			  till Christmas, but I will feel a flush of shame on your behalf, sir,
			  when Lilian Daisy sees that old, slab-sided, squeaking, secondhand,
			  leftover-from-last-year’s-stock wagon. But, sir, when Lilian Daisy
			  kneels at her little bed at night I shall get her to pray for you, and
			  ask Heaven to have mercy on you. Have you one of your business cards
			  handy, so Lilian Daisy can get your name right in her petitions?”

			  It was late in the afternoon and the day staff was absent. The night
			  editor had just come in, pulled off his coat, vest, collar, and
			  necktie, rolled up his shirtsleeves and eased down his suspenders, and
			  was getting ready for work.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Someone knocked timidly outside the door, and the night editor yelled,
			  “Come in.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  A handsome young lady with entreating blue eyes and a Psyche knot
			  entered with a rolled manuscript in her hand.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The night editor took it silently and unrolled it. It was a poem and
			  he read it half aloud with a convulsive jaw movement that resulted
			  from his organs of speech being partially engaged with about a quarter
			  of a plug of chewing tobacco. The poem ran thus:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<div class="header">
					<p>
					  A Requiem
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					<span>The soft, sweet, solemn dawn stole through</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The latticed room’s deep gloom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lay in pallid, pulseless peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fulfilled his final doom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Oh, breaking heart of mine—oh, break!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Left lonely here to mourn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My alter ego, mentor, friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus from me rudely torn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within his chamber dead he lies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stilled is his sweet lyre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How long he pored o’er midnight oil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With grand poetic fire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till came the crash, when his bright light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went out, and all was drear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my sad soul was left to wait</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In grief and anguish here.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  “When did this happen?” asked the night editor.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I wrote it last night, sir,” said the young lady. “Is it good enough
			  to print?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Last night! H’m. A little stale, but the other papers didn’t get it.
			  Now, miss,” continued the night editor, smiling and throwing out his
			  chest, “I’m going to teach you a lesson in the newspaper business. We
			  can use this item, but it’s not in proper shape. Just take that chair,
			  and I’ll rewrite it for you, showing you how to properly condense a
			  news item in order to secure its insertion.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The young lady seated herself and the night editor knitted his brows
			  and read over the poem two or three times to get the main points. He
			  then wrote a few lines upon a sheet of paper and said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Now, miss, here is the form in which your item will appear when we
			  print it:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<div class="header">
					<p>
					  Fatal Accident
					</p>
				</div>

				<p>
				  “Last evening Mr. Alter Ego of this city was killed by the
				  explosion of a kerosene lamp while at work in his room.
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  “Now, you see, miss, the item includes the main facts in the case,
			  and—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Sir!” said the young lady indignantly. “There is nothing of the kind
			  intimated in the poem. The lines are imaginary and are intended to
			  express the sorrow of a poet’s friend at his untimely demise.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Why, miss,” said the night editor, “it plainly refers to midnight oil,
			  and a crash, and when the light blew up the gent was left for dead in
			  the room.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You horrid thing,” said the young lady, “give me my manuscript. I
			  will bring it back when the literary editor is in.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I’m sorry,” said the night editor as he handed her the roll. “We’re
			  short on news tonight, and it would have made a nice little scoop.
			  Don’t happen to know of any accidents in your ward: births, runaways,
			  holdups, or breach of promise suits, do you?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  But the slamming of the door was the only answer from the fair
			  poetess.

			  Here is a man in Houston who keeps quite abreast of the times. He

			<p>
			  Last night as he was going home, a shady looking man with his hat
			  pulled over his eyes stepped out from a doorway and said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Say, gent, here’s a fine diamond ring I found in de gutter. I don’t
			  want to get into no trouble wid it. Gimme a dollar and take it.”

			<p>
			  The Houston man smiled as he looked at the flashy ring the man held

			</p>

			<p>
			  “A very good game, my man,” he said, “but the police are hot after you

			  When the man got home he found his wife in tears.

			<p>
			  “Oh, John,” she said. “I went shopping this afternoon and lost my

			</p>

			<p>
			  John turned without a word and rushed back down the street, but the

			  His wife often wonders why he never scolded her for losing the ring.

			  “Same old fool break of putting a letter in the wrong envelope, and

			  ‘Can’t possibly do it. I’ve got to meet another little thing today
			  that won’t be put off.’ I made the usual mistake and sent the merchant
			  the ten dollars and my wife the note.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Can’t you go home and explain the mistake to your wife?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You don’t know her. I’ve done all I can. I’ve taken out an accident

			  “Who bids?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The auctioneer held up a child’s rocking-horse, battered and stained.
			  It had belonged to some little member of the man’s family whose
			  household property was being sold under the hammer.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He was utterly ruined. He had given up everything in the world to his
			  creditors—house, furniture, horses, stock of goods and lands. He stood
			  among the crowd watching the sale that was scattering his household
			  goods and his heirlooms among a hundred strange hands.
			</p>

			<p>
			  On his arm leaned a woman heavily veiled. “Who bids?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The auctioneer held the rocking-horse high that it might be seen.
			  Childish hands had torn away the scanty mane; the bridle was twisted
			  and worn by tender little fingers. The crowd was still.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The woman under the heavy veil sobbed and stretched out her hands.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, no, no!” she cried.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The man was white with emotion. The little form that once so merrily
			  rode the old rockinghouse had drifted away into the world years ago.
			  This was the only relic left of his happy infancy.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The auctioneer, with a queer moisture in his eyes, handed the
			  rocking-horse to the man without a word. He seized it with eager
			  hands, and he and the veiled woman hurried away.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The crowd murmured with sympathy.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The man and the woman went into an empty room and set the
			  rocking-horse down. He took out his knife, ripped open the front of
			  the horse, and took out a roll of bills. He counted them and said:
			  “It’s a cold day when I fail without a rake-off. Eight thousand five
			  hundred dollars, but that auctioneer came very near busting up the
			  game.”

			<h3 class="storytitle">An Opportunity Declined</h3>

			<p>
			  A farmer who lives about four miles from Houston noticed a stranger in
			  his front yard one afternoon last week acting in a rather unusual
			  manner. He wore a pair of duck trousers stuffed in his boots, and had
			  a nose the color of Elgin pressed brick. In his hand he held a
			  sharpened stake about two feet long, which he would stick into the
			  ground, and after sighting over it at various objects would pull it up
			  and go through the same performance at another place.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The farmer went out in the yard and inquired what he wanted.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Wait just a minute,” said the stranger, squinting his eye over the
			  stick at the chicken house. “Now, that’s it to a <i>T</i>. You see,
			  I’m one of de odnance corps of engineers what’s runnin’ de line of the
			  new railroad from Columbus, Ohio, to Houston. See? De other fellers is
			  over de hill wid de transit and de baggage. Dere’s over a million
			  dollars in de company. See? Dey sent me on ahead to locate a place for
			  a big passenger depot, to cost $27,000. De foundation will commence
			  right by your chicken house. Say, I gives you a pointer. You charge
			  ’em high for dis land. Dey’ll stand fifty thousand. ’Cause why? ’Cause
			  dey’s got de money and dey’s got to build de depot right where I says.
			  See? I’ve got to go on into Houston to record a deed for a right of
			  way, and I never thought to get fifty cents from de treasurer. He’s a
			  little man with light pants. You might let me have de fifty cents and
			  when de boys comes along in de mornin’ tell ’em what you did, and any
			  one of ’em’ hand you a dollar. You might ask ’em fifty-five thousand,
			  if you—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You throw that stick over the fence, and get the axe and cut up
			  exactly half a cord of that wood, stove length, and I’ll give you a
			  quarter and your supper,” said the farmer. “Does the proposition
			  strike you favorably?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “And are you goin’ to t’row away de opportunity of havin’ dat depot
			  built right here, and sellin’ out—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes, I need the ground for my chicken coop.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You refuse to take $50,000 for de ground, den?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I do. Are you going to chop that wood, or shall I whistle for Tige?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Gimme dat axe, mister, and show me dat wood, and tell de missus to
			  bake an extra pan of biscuits for supper. When dat Columbus and
			  Houston grand trunk railway runs up against your front fence you’ll be
			  sorry you didn’t take up dat offer. And tell her to fill up the

		<div id="correcting-a-great-injustice" class="story">
			<h3 class="storytitle">Correcting a Great Injustice</h3>

			<p>
			  Something has been recently disclosed that will fill every chivalrous
			  man in the country with contrition. For a long time men have supposed
			  that the habit of wearing tall hats at the theater by the ladies was
			  nothing more than a lack of consideration on their part for the
			  unfortunate individuals who were so unlucky as to get a seat behind
			  them.
			</p>

			<p>
			  It now appears that the supposition did the fair sex a great
			  injustice. A noted female physician has exposed an affliction that the
			  female sex has long suffered with, and have succeeded up to this time
			  in keeping a profound secret. Their habit of wearing hats in places of
			  public entertainment is the result of a necessity, and relieves them
			  of the charge of selfish disregard of the convenience of others, which
			  has been so often brought against them.
			</p>

			<p>
			  It appears that ladies who are past thirty-five years of age are
			  peculiarly sensitive to the effect of a bright light striking upon
			  their heads from above. The skull of a woman is quite different from
			  that of a man, especially on the top, and at the age of thirty-five,
			  the texture of the skull at this place becomes very light. Rays of
			  light—especially electric light—have a peculiarly penetrating and
			  disturbing effect upon the cerebral nerves.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Strange to say, this infirmity is never felt by a young woman, but as
			  soon as she passes the heyday of youth, it is at once perceptible. The
			  fact is generally known to women, and discussed among themselves, but
			  they have jealously guarded the secret, even from their nearest male
			  relatives and friends. The lady physician who recently exposed the
			  matter in a scientific journal is the first of her sex to make it
			  known to the public.
			</p>

			<p>
			  If anyone will take the trouble to make a test of the statement, its
			  truth will be unquestionably proven. Engage a woman of middle age in
			  conversation beneath a well-lighted chandelier, and in a few moments
			  she will grow uneasy, and very soon the pain inflicted by the light
			  will cause her to move away from under its source. On young and
			  healthy girls the rays of light have no perceptible effect. So, when
			  we see a lady at a theater wearing a tall and cumbersome hat, we
			  should reflect that she is more than thirty-five years old, and is
			  simply protecting herself from an affliction that advancing years have
			  brought upon her. Whenever we observe one wearing small and
			  unobtrusive headgear we know that she is still young and charming, and
			  can yet sit beneath the rays of penetrating light without
			  inconvenience.
			</p>

			<p>
			  No man who has had occasion to rail against woman’s supposed
			  indifference to the public comfort in this respect, will hesitate to
			  express sincere regret that he has so misunderstood them. It is
			  characteristic of Americans to respect the infirmities of age,
			  especially among the fair sex, and when the facts here narrated have
			  been generally known, pity and toleration will take the place of
			  censure. Henceforth a tall hat, with nodding feathers and clustering
			  flowers and trimming, will not be regarded with aversion when we see
			  it between us and the stage, but with respect, since we are assured
			  that its wearer is no longer young, but is already on the down hill of
			  life, and is forced to take the precaution that advancing years render
			  necessary to infirm women.
			</p>

		<div id="a-startling-demonstration" class="story">
			<h3 class="storytitle">A Startling Demonstration</h3>

			<p>
			  What a terrible state of affairs it would be if we could read each
			  other’s minds! It is safe to say that if such were the case, most of
			  us would be afraid to think above a whisper.
			</p>

			<p>
			  As an illustration, a case might be cited that occurred in Houston.
			  Some months ago a very charming young lady came to this city giving
			  exhibitions in mind reading, and proved herself to be marvelously
			  gifted in that respect. She easily read the thoughts of the audience,
			  finding many articles hidden by simply holding the hand of the person
			  secreting them, and read sentences written on little slips of paper by
			  some at a considerable distance from her.
			</p>

			<p>
			  A young man in Houston fell in love with her, and married her after a
			  short courtship. They went to housekeeping and for a time were as
			  happy as mortals can be.
			</p>

			<p>
			  One evening they were sitting on the porch of their residence holding
			  each other’s hands, and wrapt in the close communion of mutual love,
			  when she suddenly rose and knocked him down the steps with a large
			  flowerpot. He arose astonished, with a big bump on his head, and asked
			  her, if it were not too much trouble, to explain.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You can’t fool me,” she said with flashing eyes. “You were thinking
			  of a redheaded girl named Maud with a gold plug in her front tooth and
			  a light pink waist and a black silk skirt on Rusk Avenue, standing
			  under a cedar bush chewing gum at twenty minutes to eight with your
			  arm around her waist and calling her ‘sweetness,’ while she fooled
			  with your watch chain and said: ‘Oh, George, give me a chance to
			  breathe,’ and her mother was calling her to supper. Don’t you dare to
			  deny it. Now, when you can get your mind on something better than
			  that, you can come in the house and not before.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Then the door slammed and George and the broken flowerpot were alone.

				<p>
				  <span class="salutation">Gentlemen</span>: This being leap year I
				  arose this morning at daybreak, resolved to utilize every moment
				  of the time possible. Four years ago, I wrote and received some
				  very valuable advice from you in regard to the exercise of the
				  privileges of my sex (female) during the leap year season. I
				  followed your advice strictly, and in the year 1892 proposed
				  marriage to twenty-seven different men. I am still single, but am
				  not to blame for that. I was engaged to three men in 1892, and,
				  but for the unforeseen bad luck, would certainly have married at
				  least one of them. Two of them committed suicide the day before
				  the wedding and the other got his hat and walking cane and went to
				  Patagonia. I see in the papers that the year 1900 will not be a
				  leap year, and I realize that for the next twelve months I have
				  got to carry on a red hot aggressive campaign, as eight more years
				  will decidedly weaken my chances. Any suggestions you may make
				  that will aid me will be appreciated. I enclose my photo. I am
				  nearly thirty-six, and sleep on my left side.

                <p class="valediction">Faithfully yours,</p>

			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  This is an awful subject to speak lightly upon, and the few words of
			  advice we propose giving are sincere and well weighed.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Your photograph shows that whatever you do must be done quickly. A
			  good way for a lady of your age and cut of collar bones to open New
			  Year would be with prayer and massage. It may be a defect in the
			  retouching of your photo, but still, it would not be amiss to take a
			  good Turkish bath and then go over low places with plaster of Paris
			  applied with a common case knife with gentle downward motion,
			  breathing as usual, and dry in the sun, turning over frequently two or
			  three hours before eating. You should not waste any time in selecting
			  a man. Try the milkman first, as he generally comes before it is very
			  light.
			</p>

			<p>
			  As the milkman will no doubt refuse you, be prepared to give the
			  postman a shock. Do not be too abrupt in proposing, as a rude shock of
			  this nature will often cause a timid man to stampede, causing great
			  loss of confidence and bric-a-brac.
			</p>

			<p>
			  After getting a victim to stand, speak gently to him until he ceases
			  to quiver in his limbs and roll his eyes. Do not pat his chest, or rub
			  his nose, as men will sometimes kick at this treatment. Bear in mind
			  the fact that 1900 is not leap year, and keep between him and the
			  door.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Approach the subject gradually, allowing him no time to pray and
			  remove the cigars from his vest pocket. If he should shudder and turn
			  pale, turn the conversation upon progressive euchre, Braun’s egotism,
			  or some other light subject, until a handkerchief applied to his neck
			  will not come off wet. If possible, get him to seat himself, and then,
			  grasping both lapels of his coat, breathe heavily upon him, and speak
			  of your lonely life.
			</p>

			<p>
			  At this stage he will mutter incoherently, answer at random, and try
			  to climb up the chimney. When his pulse gets to 195, and he begins to
			  babble of green fields and shows only the whites of his eyes, strike
			  him on the point of the chin, propose, chloroform him, and telephone
			  for a minister.

			  Last week “The Rainmakers” gave two performances in Houston. At the
			  night performance a prominent local politician occupied one of the
			  front seats, as near to the stage as possible. He carried in his hand
			  a glossy silk hat, and he seemed to be in a state of anxious suspense,
			  fidgeting about in his chair, and holding his hat in both hands
			  straight before him. A friend who occupied a seat directly behind,
			  leaned over and asked the cause of his agitation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I’ll tell you, Bill,” said the politician in a confidential whisper,
			  “just how it is. I’ve been in politics now for ten years, and I’ve
			  been bemoaned and abused and cussed out, and called so many hard names
			  that I thought I’d like to be addressed in a decent manner once more
			  before I die, and this is about the only opportunity I shall have.
			  There is a sleight-of-hand performance between two of the acts in this
			  show, and the professor is going to step down to the front and say:
			  ‘Will some gentleman kindly loan me a hat?’ Then I’m going to stand up
			  and give him mine, and it’ll make me feel good for a week. I haven’t
			  been called a gentleman in so long. I expect I’ll whoop right out hard
			  when he takes the hat. Excuse me now. I’ve got to be ready and get my
			  hat in first. I see one of the city councilmen over there with an old
			  derby in his hand, and I’ll bet he’s up to the same game.”

			  His coat was rusty and his hat out of style, but his nose glasses,
			  secured by a black cord, lent him a distinguished air, and his manner
			  was jaunty and assured. He stepped into a new Houston grocery
			  yesterday, and greeted the proprietor cordially.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I’ll have to introduce myself,” he said. “My name is ———, and I live
			  next door to the house you have just moved in. Saw you at church
			  Sunday. Our minister also observed you, and after church he says,
			  ‘Brother ———, you must really find out who that intelligent-looking
			  stranger is who listened so attentively today.’ How did you like the
			  sermon?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Very well,” said the grocer as he picked some funny-looking currants
			  with wings out of a jar.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes, he is a very eloquent and pious man. You have not been in
			  business long in Houston, have you?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Three weeks,” said the grocer, as he removed the cheese knife from
			  the box to the shelf behind him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Our people,” said the rusty-looking man, “are whole-souled and
			  hospitable. There is no welcome too warm for them to extend to a
			  newcomer, and the members of our church in particular are especially
			  friendly toward anyone who drops in to worship with us. You have a
			  nice stock of goods.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “So, so,” said the grocer, turning his back and gazing up at a supply
			  of canned California fruits.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Only last week now I had quite an altercation with the tradesman I
			  deal with for sending me inferior goods. You have some nice hams, I
			  suppose, and such staples as coffee and sugar?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yep,” said the grocer.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “My wife was over to see your wife this morning, and enjoyed her visit
			  very much. What time does your delivery wagon pass up our street?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Say,” said the grocer. “I bought out an old stock of groceries here,
			  and put in a lot of new ones. I see your name on the old books charged
			  with $87.10 balance on account. Did you want something more today?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, sir,” said the rusty man, drawing himself up and glaring through
			  his glasses. “I merely called in from a sense of Christian duty to
			  extend you a welcome, but I see you are not the man I took you to be.
			  I don’t want any of your groceries. I can see the mites in that cheese
			  from the other side of the street, and my wife says your wife is
			  wearing an underskirt made out of an old tablecloth. Several of our
			  congregation were speaking of your smelling of toddy in church, and
			  snoring during the prayers. My wife will return that cup of lard she
			  borrowed at your house this morning just as quick as my last order
			  comes up from the store where we trade. Good morning, sir.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The grocer softly whispered, “There Won’t Anybody Play with Me,” and
			  whittled a little lead out of one of his weights, in an absentminded
			  way.

			  Jeremiah Q. Dilworthy lives away up on San Jacinto Street. He walks

			  He was a great practical joker, and never lost a chance to get a good

			  said, confidentially:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I never would have believed it, but I believe it my duty to make it
			  known. Mr. ———, the alderman for our ward, has been taking hush money.”

			  “Impossible!” said his friend.

			  “I tell you, it’s true, for I overheard the conversation and actually

			  from the encounter to the extent of two black eyes and a coat split up
			  the back.

			  A Houston gentleman who is worth somewhere up in the hundreds of

			  and closed the door carefully behind him. The man had an evil,
			  villainous-looking face, and in his hand he held with the utmost care
			  an oblong, square-shaped package. “What do you want?” asked the
			  capitalist.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I must have money,” hissed the stranger. “I am starving while you are
			  rolling in wealth. Do you see this little package? Do you know what it
			  contains?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The wealthy citizen sprang from his desk in horror, pale with fright.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, no,” he gasped. “You would not be so cruel, so heartless.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “This package,” continued the desperate man, “contains enough
			  dynamite, if let fall upon the floor, to hurl this building into a

			  “Is that all?” said the capitalist, sinking into his chair and picking

			<h3 class="storytitle">A Villainous Trick</h3>

			<p>
			  When it becomes necessary for an actor to write a letter during the
			  performance of a play, it is a custom to read the words aloud as he
			  writes them. It is necessary to do this in order that the audience may
			  be apprised of its contents, otherwise the clearness of the plot might
			  be obscured. The writing of a letter upon the stage, therefore,
			  generally has an important bearing upon the situation being presented,
			  and of course the writer is forced to read aloud what he writes for
			  the benefit of the audience. During the production of “Monbars” in
			  Houston some days ago, the gentleman who assumed the character of the
			  heavy villain took advantage of a situation of this description in a
			  most cowardly manner.
			</p>

			<p>
			  In the last act, Mantell, as Monbars, writes a letter of vital
			  importance, and, as customary, reads the lines aloud as he writes
			  them. The villain hides behind the curtains of a couch and listens in
			  fiendish glee to the contents of the letter as imparted by Mr. Mantell
			  in strict confidence to the audience. He then uses the information
			  obtained in this underhanded manner to further his own devilish
			  designs.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Mr. Mantell ought not to allow this. A man who is a member of his own
			  company, and who, no doubt is drawing a good salary, should be above
			  taking a mean advantage of a mere stage technicality.

			<p>
			  We find on our table quite an exhaustive treatise on various subjects,
			  written in Mr. Webster’s well-known, lucid, and piquant style. There
			  is not a dull line between the covers of the book. The range of
			  subjects is wide, and the treatment light and easy without being
			  flippant. A valuable feature of the work is the arranging of the
			  articles in alphabetical order, thus facilitating the finding of any
			  particular word desired. Mr. Webster’s vocabulary is large, and he
			  always uses the right word in the right place. Mr. Webster’s work is
			  thorough and we predict that he will be heard from again.

			  This new book has the decided merit of being non-sensational. In these
			  days of erratic and ultra-imaginative literature of the modern morbid
			  self-analytical school it is a relief to peruse a book with so little
			  straining after effect, so well balanced, and so pure in sentiment. It
			  is a book that a man can place in the hands of the most innocent
			  member of his family with the utmost confidence. Its material is
			  healthy, and its literary style excellent, as it adheres to the
			  methods used with such thrilling effect by Mr. Webster in his famous
			  dictionary, viz: alphabetical arrangement.

			<h3 class="storytitle">Bill Nye</h3>

			<p>
			  Bill Nye, who recently laid down his pen for all time, was a unique
			  figure in the field of humor. His best work probably more nearly
			  represented American humor than that of any other writer. Mr. Nye had
			  a sense of ludicrous that was keen and judicious. His humor was
			  peculiarly American in that it depended upon sharp and unexpected
			  contrasts, and the bringing of opposites into unlooked-for comparison
			  for its effect. Again, he had the true essence of kindliness, without
			  which humor is stripped of its greatest component part.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Bill Nye’s jokes never had a sting. They played like summer lightning
			  around the horizon of life, illuminating and spreading bright, if
			  transitory, pictures upon the sky, but they were as harmless as the
			  smile of a child. The brain of the man conceived the swift darts that
			  he threw, but his great manly heart broke off their points.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He knew human nature as a scholar knows his book, and the knowledge
			  did not embitter him. He saw all the goodness in frailty, and his
			  clear eyes penetrated the frailty of goodness.
			</p>

			<p>
			  His was the child’s heart, the scholar’s knowledge, and the
			  philosopher’s view of life. He might have won laurels in other fields,
			  for he was a careful reasoner, and a close observer, but he showed his
			  greatness in putting aside cold and fruitless discussions that have
			  wearied the world long ago, and set himself the task of arousing
			  bubbling laughter instead of consuming doubt.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The world has been better for him, and when that can be said of a man,
			  the tears that drop upon his grave are more potent than the loud
			  huzzas that follow the requiem of the greatest conqueror or the most
			  successful statesman.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The kindliest thoughts and the sincerest prayers follow the great
			  humanitarian—for such he was into the great beyond, and such solace as
			  the hearty condolement of a million people can bring to the bereaved
			  loved ones of Bill Nye, is theirs.

			<h3 class="storytitle">A Guarded Secret</h3>

			<p>
			  It is time to call a halt upon the persistent spreaders of the alleged
			  joke that a woman can not keep a secret. No baser ingratitude has been
			  shown by man toward the fair sex than the promulgation of this false
			  report. Whenever a would-be humorous man makes use of this antiquated
			  chestnut which his fellow men feel in duty bound to applaud, the face
			  of the woman takes on a strange, inscrutable, pitying smile that few
			  men ever read.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The truth is that it is only woman who can keep a secret. Only a
			  divine intelligence can understand the marvelous power with which
			  ninety-nine married women out of a hundred successfully hide from the
			  rest of the world the secret that they have bound themselves to
			  something unworthy of the pure and sacrificing love they have given
			  them. She may whisper to her neighbor that Mrs. Jones has turned her
			  old silk dress twice, but if she has in her breast anything affecting
			  one she loves, the gods themselves could not drag it from her.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Weak man looks into the wine cup and behold, he babbles his innermost
			  thoughts to any gaping bystander; woman can babble of the weather, and
			  gaze with infantine eyes into the orbs of the wiliest diplomat, while
			  holding easily in her breast the heaviest secrets of state.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Adam was the original blab; the first telltale, and we are not proud
			  of him. With the dreamy, appealing eyes of Eve upon him—she who was
			  created for his comfort and pleasure—even as she stood by his side,
			  loving and fresh and fair as a spring moon, the wretched cad said,
			  “The woman gave me and I did eat.” This reprehensible act in our
			  distinguished forefather can not be excused by any gentleman who knows
			  what is due to a lady.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Adam’s conduct would have caused his name to be stricken from the list
			  of every decent club in the country. And since that day, woman has
			  stood by man, faithful, true, and ready to give up all for his sake.
			  She hides his puny peccadilloes from the world, she glosses over his
			  wretched misdemeanors, and she keeps silent when a word would pierce
			  his inflated greatness and leave him a shriveled and shrunken rag.
			</p>

			<p>
			  And man says that woman can not keep a secret!
			</p>

			<p>
			  Let him be thankful that she can, or his littleness would be
			  proclaimed from the housetops.

			<h3 class="storytitle">Board and Ancestors</h3>

			<p>
			  The snake reporter of the Post was wending his way homeward last night
			  when he was approached by a very gaunt, hungry-looking man with wild
			  eyes and an emaciated face.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Can you tell me, sir,” he inquired, “where I can find in Houston a
			  family of lowborn scrubs?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I don’t exactly understand,” said the reporter.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Let me tell you how it is,” said the emaciated man. “I came to
			  Houston a month ago, and I hunted up a boarding house, as I can not
			  afford to live at a hotel. I found a nice, aristocratic-looking place
			  that suited me, and went inside. The landlady came in the parlor and
			  she was a very stately lady with a Roman nose. I asked the price of
			  board, and she said: ‘Eighty dollars per month.’ I fell against the
			  door jamb with a dull thud, and she said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “ ‘You seem surprised, sah. You will please remember that I am the
			  widow of Governah Riddle of Virginia. My family is very highly
			  connected; give you board as a favah; I never consider money an
			  equivalent to advantage of my society. Will you have a room with a
			  door in it?’
			</p>

			<p>
			  “ ‘I’ll call again,’ I said, and got out of the house, somehow, and
			  went to another fine, three-storied house, with a sign ‘Board and
			  Rooms’ on it.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “The next lady I saw had gray curls, and a soft gazelle-like eye. She
			  was a cousin of General Mahone of Virginia and wanted $16 per week for
			  a little back room with a pink motto and a picture of the battle of
			  Chancellorsville in it.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I went to some more boarding houses.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “The next lady said she was descended from Aaron Burr on one side and
			  Captain Kidd on the other. She was using the Captain Kidd side in her
			  business. She wanted to charge me sixty cents an hour for board and
			  lodging. I traveled around all over Houston and found nine widows of
			  Supreme Court judges, twelve relicts of governors and generals, and
			  twenty-two ruins left by happy departed colonels, professors, and
			  majors, who put fancy figures on the benefits of their society, and
			  carried victuals as a side line.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I finally grew desperately hungry and engaged a week’s board at a
			  nice, stylish mansion in the third ward. The lady who kept it was tall
			  and imposing. She kept one hand lying across her waist and the other
			  held a prayer book and a pair of ice hooks. She said she was an aunt
			  of Davy Crockett, and was still in mourning for him. Her family was
			  one of the first in Texas. It was then supper time and I went in to
			  supper. Supper was from six-fifty to seven, and consisted of baker’s
			  bread, prayer, and cold slaw. I was so fatigued that I begged to be
			  shown to my room immediately after the meal.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I took the candle, went into the room she showed me, and locked the
			  door quickly. The room was furnished in imitation of the Alamo. The
			  walls and the floor were bare, and the bed was something like a
			  monument only harder. About midnight I felt something as if I had
			  fallen into a prickly pear bush, and jumped up and lit the candle. I
			  looked in the bed and then put on my clothes, and exclaimed:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “ ‘Thermopylae had her messenger of defeat, but the Alamo had a
			  thousand.’
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I slipped out of the door and left the house.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Now, my dear sir, I am not wealthy, and I can not afford to pay for
			  high lineage and moldy ancestors with my board. Corned beef goes
			  further with me than a coronet, and when I am cold a coat-of-arms does
			  not warm me. I am desperate and hungry, and I hate everybody who can
			  trace their ancestors farther back than the late Confederate Reunion.
			  I want to find a boarding house whose proprietress was left while an
			  infant in a basket at a livery stable, whose father was an
			  unnaturalized dago from the fifth ward, and whose grandfather was
			  never placed upon the map. I want to strike a low-down, scrubby,
			  piebald, sans-culotte outfit that never heard of finger bowls or grace
			  before meals but who can get up a mess of hot corn bread and Irish
			  stew at regular market quotations. Is there any such place in
			  Houston?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The snake reporter shook his head sadly. “I never heard of any,” he
			  said. “The boarding houses here are run by ladies who do not take
			  boarders to make a living; they are all trying to get a better rating
			  in Bradstreet’s than Hetty Green.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Then,” said the emaciated man desperately, “I will shake you for a
			  long toddy.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The snake reporter felt in his vest pocket haughtily for a moment, and
			  then refusing the proposition scornfully, moved away down the dimly
			  lighted street.

			<h3 class="storytitle">An X-Ray Fable</h3>

			<p>
			  And it came to pass that a man with a Cathode Ray went about the
			  country finding out and showing the people, for a consideration, the
			  insides of folks’ heads and what they were thinking about. And he
			  never made a mistake.
			</p>

			<p>
			  And in a certain town lived a man whose name was Reuben and a maid
			  whose name was Ruth. And the two were sweethearts and were soon to be
			  married.
			</p>

			<p>
			  And Reuben came to the man and hired him with coin to take a snap shot
			  at Ruth’s head, and find out whom she truly loved.
			</p>

			<p>
			  And later on Ruth came and also hired the man to find out whom Reuben
			  truly loved. And the man did so and got two good negatives.
			</p>

			<p>
			  In the meantime Reuben and Ruth confessed to each other what they had
			  done, and the next day they came together, hand in hand, to the man
			  with the Ray, for their answer. The man saw them, and he wrote two
			  names on two slips of paper and gave them into their hands.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “On these slips of paper,” he said, “you will find the name of the one
			  whom each of you loves best in the world, as truly discovered by my
			  wonderful Cathode Ray.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  And the man and the maid opened the pieces of paper and saw written on
			  one “Reuben” and on the other “Ruth,” and they were filled with joy
			  and happiness, and went away with arms about each other’s waists.
			</p>

			<p>
			  But the man with the Ray neglected to mention the fact that the
			  photographs he had taken showed that Reuben’s head was full of deep
			  and abiding love for Reuben and Ruth’s showed her to be passionately
			  enamored of Ruth.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The moral is that the proprietor of the Ray probably knew his
			  business.

			  “Is the literary editor in?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The sporting editor looked up from the paper he was reading, and saw a
			  vision of female loveliness about twenty years of age, with soft blue
			  eyes, and a heavy mass of golden brown hair arranged in a coiffure of
			  the latest and most becoming style.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Nope,” said the sporting editor, “you can bet your life he ain’t in.
			  He’s out trying to get bail for having assaulted a man who wrote to
			  the Letter Box to ask if ten men could build a house in twenty-seven
			  and one-half days by working eight hours a day, how many buttons would
			  be required for a coat of paint for same house. Did you call to see
			  about a poem, or did you want him to sneak you some coupons for the
			  bicycle contest?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Neither,” said the young lady, with dignity. “I am the secretary of
			  the Houston Young Ladies’ Society of Ethical Culture, and I was
			  appointed a committee to call upon the literary editor and consult him
			  as to the best plan for the exercise of our various functions.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Now, that’s a good thing,” said the sporting editor. “I don’t seem to
			  exactly catch on to ‘ethical,’ but if it’s anything like physical
			  culture you girls are going in for, you’ve trotted up to the right
			  rack. I can tell you more about the proper way to exercise your
			  functions in one minute than the literary editor can in an hour. He
			  understands all about the identity of the wherefore and the origin of
			  the pyramids, but he can’t punch the bag, or give you any pointers how
			  to increase your chest measurement. How long has your society been in

			<p>
			  “Sir?”

			<p>
			  “Oh, you’ll have to start in right, and you’ve got to know how to

			  standing on one leg, try to—”
			</p>

			  “Sir!” exclaimed the young lady severely, “you are presumptuous. I do
			  not understand your obscure talk. Our society is not connected with a

			</p>

			<p>
			  “Oh,” returned the sporting editor, in a disappointed tone, “you are
			  on the society and pink tea racket. Sorry. That lets me out. Hoped you
			  were going in for athletics. You could do it so well, too. Take my
			  advice now, and try that little exercise every morning for a week.

			  A man with a long, sharp nose and a big bundle which he carried by a

			  bundle down, rang the bell, and took off his hat and wiped his brow.
			</p>

			<p>
			  A woman opened the door and he said: “Madam, I have a number of not

			  “Have smart servants, have you? Well, that is a blessing. Now, here is

			  The long-nosed man made a convulsive grab at his goods and rolled down

			  just as a man got out of a buggy and nailed a yellow flag on the

			<p>
			  So the king fell into a furious rage, so that none durst go near him
			  for fear, and he gave out that since the Princess Astla had disobeyed
			  him there would be a great tourney, and to the knight who should prove
			  himself of the greatest valor he would give the hand of the princess.
			</p>

			<p>
			  And he sent forth a herald to proclaim that he would do this.
			</p>

			<p>
			  And the herald went about the country making his desire known, blowing
			  a great tin horn and riding a noble steed that pranced and gamboled;
			  and the villagers gazed upon him with awe and said: “Lo, that is one
			  of them tin horn gamblers concerning which the chroniclers have told
			  us.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  And when the day came, the king sat in the grandstand, holding the
			  gage of battle in his hand, and by his side sat the Princess Astla,
			  looking very pale and beautiful, but with mournful eyes from which she
			  scarce could keep the tears, and the knights who came to the tourney
			  gazed upon the princess in wonder at her beauty, and each swore to win
			  her so that he could marry her and board with the king. Suddenly the
			  heart of the princess gave a great bound, for she saw among the
			  knights one of the poor students with whom she had been in love.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The knights mounted and rode in a line past the grandstand, and the
			  king stopped the poor student, who had the worst horse and the poorest
			  caparisons of any of the knights, and said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Sir knight, prithee tell me of what that marvelous shaky and
			  rusty-looking armor of thine is made?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Oh, king,” said the young knight, “seeing that we are about to engage
			  in a big fight, I would call it scrap iron, wouldn’t you?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Ods bodikins!” said the king. “The youth hath a pretty wit.”
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<p>
			  The tourney lasted the whole day and at the end but two of the knights
			  were left, one of them being the princess’s lover.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Here’s enough for a fight, anyhow,” said the king. “Come hither, oh
			  knights, will ye joust for the hand of this lady fair?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “We joust will,” said the knights.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The two knights fought for two hours and at length the princess’s
			  lover prevailed and stretched the other upon the ground. The
			  victorious knight made his horse caracole before the king, and bowed
			  low in his saddle.
			</p>

			<p>
			  On the Princess Astla’s cheek was a rosy flush; in her eyes the light
			  of excitement vied with the soft glow of love; her lips were parted,
			  her lovely hair unbound, and she grasped the arms of her chair and
			  leaned forward with heaving bosom and happy smile to hear the words of
			  her lover.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You have fought well, sir knight,” said the king. “And if there is
			  any boon you crave you have but to name it.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Then,” said the knight, “I will ask you this: I have bought the
			  patent rights in your kingdom for Schneider’s celebrated monkey wrench
			  and I want a letter from you endorsing it.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You shall have it,” said the king, “but I must tell you that there is
			  not a monkey in my kingdom.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  With a yell of rage the victorious knight threw himself on his horse
			  and rode away at a furious gallop.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The king was about to speak when a horrible suspicion flashed upon him
			  and he fell dead upon the grandstand.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “My God!” he cried, as he expired, “he has forgotten to take the
			  princess with him.”

			  The Memphis Commercial-Appeal, in commenting on errors in grammar made
			  by magazines, takes exception to an error in construction occurring in
			  Gode’s Magazine in which, in J. H. Connelly’s story entitled
			  “Mr. Pettigrew’s Bad Dog,” a character is made to say: “You will be
			  lucky if you escape with only marrying one.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  A man says this to another one who is being besieged by two ladies,
			  and the Commercial-Appeal thinks he intended to say: “You will be
			  lucky if you escape with marrying only one.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Now, after considering the question, it seems likely that there is
			  more in Mr. J. H. Connelly’s remark than is dreamed of in the
			  philosophy of the Commercial-Appeal.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The history of matrimony gives color to the belief that, to whichever
			  one of the ladies the gentleman might unite himself, he would be lucky
			  if he escaped with only marrying her. Getting married is the easiest
			  part of the affair. It is what comes afterward that makes a man
			  sometimes wish a wolf had carried him into the forest when he was a
			  little boy. It takes only a little nerve, a black coat, from five to
			  ten dollars, and a girl, for a man to get married. Very few men are
			  lucky enough to escape with only marrying a woman. Women are sometimes
			  so capricious and unreasonable that they demand that a man stay around
			  afterward, and board and clothe them, and build fires, and chop wood,
			  and rock the chickens out of the garden, and tell the dressmaker when
			  to send in her bill again.
			</p>

			<p>
			  We would like to read “Mr. Pettigrew’s Bad Dog” and find out whether
			  the man was lucky enough to only marry the lady, or whether she held
			  on to him afterward and didn’t let him escape.

			<h3 class="storytitle">The “Bad Man”</h3>

			<p>
			  A bold, bad man made a general display of himself in a Texas town a
			  few days ago. It seems that he’d imbibed a sufficient number of drinks
			  to become anxious to impress the town with his badness, and when the
			  officers tried to arrest him he backed up against the side of a
			  building and defied arrest. A considerable crowd of citizens, among
			  whom were a number of drummers from a hotel close by, had gathered to
			  witness the scene.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The bad man was a big, ferocious-looking fellow with long, curling
			  hair that fell on his shoulders, a broad-brimmed hat, a buckskin coat
			  with fringe around the bottom, and a picturesque vocabulary. He was
			  flourishing a big six-shooter and swore by the bones of Davy Crockett
			  that he would perforate the man who attempted to capture him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The city marshal stood in the middle of the street and tried to reason
			  with him, but the bad man gave a whoop and rose up on his toes, and
			  the whole crowd fell back to the other side of the street. The police
			  had a conference, but none of them would volunteer to lead the attack.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Presently a little, wizened, consumptive-looking drummer for a
			  Connecticut shoe factory squeezed his way through the crowd on the
			  opposite side of the street to have a peep at the desperado. He
			  weighed about ninety pounds and wore double glass spectacles. Just
			  then the desperado gave another whoop and yelled:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Gol darn ye, why don’t some of ye come and take me? I’ll eat any five
			  of ye without chawin’, and I ain’t hungry either—whoopee!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The crowd fell back a few yards further and the police turned pale
			  again, but the skinny little man adjusted his spectacles with both
			  hands, and stepped on to the edge of the sidewalk and took a good look
			  at the bad men. Then he deliberately struck across the street at a
			  funny hopping kind of a run right up to where the terror stood.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The crowd yelled at him to come back, and the desperado flourished his
			  six-shooter again, but the little man went straight up to him and said
			  something. The crowd shuddered and expected to see him fall with a
			  forty-five bullet in him, but he didn’t. They saw the desperado lower
			  his pistol and run his hand in his pocket and hand something to the
			  little man.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Then the desperado walked sheepishly down the sidewalk, and the little
			  man came back across the street.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Bad man?” he said. “I guess not. He wouldn’t hurt a fly. That’s Zeke
			  Skinner. He was raised on the farm next to me in Connecticut. He’s
			  selling some kind of fake liver medicine, and that’s his street rig
			  he’s got on now. I loaned him eight dollars in Hartford nine years
			  ago, and never expected to see him again. Thought I knew his voice.
			  Pay? I reckon he paid me. I calculate I always collect what’s owing to
			  me.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Then the crowd scattered and the twelve policeman headed Zeke off at
			  the next corner and clubbed him all the way to the station house.

			  An ordinary-looking man wearing a last season’s negligee shirt stepped
			  into the business office and unrolled a strip of manuscript some three
			  feet long.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I wanted to see you about this little thing I want to publish in the
			  paper. There are fifteen verses besides the other reading matter. The
			  verses are on spring. My handwriting is a trifle illegible and I may
			  have to read it over to you. This is the way it runs:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p class="title">Spring</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The air is full of gentle zephyrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grass is growing green;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Winter now has surely left us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spring has come, I ween.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“When the sun has set, the vapors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rise from out the meadows low;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the stars are lit like tapers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then the night winds chilly blow.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  “Take that stuff up to the editorial department,” said the business
			  manager shortly.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I have been up there already,” said the ordinary-looking man, “and
			  they sent me down here. This will fill about a column. I want to talk
			  with you about the price. The last verse runs this way:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<p>
					<span>“Then it is that weakening languors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thicken in our veins the blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we must ward off these dangers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere we find our names are ‘Mud.’ ”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  “The reading matter that follows is, as you see, typewritten, and
			  easily read. Now, I—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “D——n it,” said the business manager. “Don’t you come in here reading
			  your old spring poems to me. I’ve been bored already today with a lot
			  of ink and paper drummers. Why don’t you go to work instead of fooling
			  away your time on rot like that?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I didn’t mean to bother you,” said the other man, rolling up his
			  manuscript. “Is there another paper in the city?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes, there’s a few. Have you got a family?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes, sir.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Then why in thunder don’t you get into some decent business, instead
			  of going around writing confounded trash and reading it to busy
			  people? Ain’t you got any manhood about you?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Excuse me for troubling you,” said the ordinary-looking man, as he
			  walked toward the door. “I tell you how it is. I cleared over $80,000
			  last year on these little things I write. I am placing my spring and
			  summer ads for the Sarsaparilla firm of which I am a member. I had
			  decided to place about $1,000 in advertising in this town. I will see
			  the other papers you spoke of. Good morning!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The business manager has since become so cautious that all the amateur
			  poets in the city now practice reading their verses to him, and he
			  listens without a murmur.

			  Few nights ago in a rather tough saloon in a little town on the
			  Central Railroad, a big, strapping desperado, who had an unenviable
			  reputation as a bad man generally, walked up to the bar and in a loud
			  voice ordered everybody in the saloon to walk up and take a drink. The
			  crowd moved quickly to the bar at his invitation, as the man was half
			  drunk and was undoubtedly dangerous when in that condition.
			</p>

			<p>
			  One man alone failed to accept the invitation. He was a rather small
			  man, neatly dressed, who sat calmly in his chair, gazing idly at the
			  crowd. A student of physiognomy would have been attracted by the
			  expression of his face, which was one of cool determination and force
			  of will. His jaw was square and firm, and his eye gray and steady,
			  with that peculiar gray glint in the iris that presages more danger
			  than any other kind of optic.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The bully looked around and saw that someone had declined his
			  invitation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He repeated it in a louder voice.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The small man rose to his feet and walked coolly toward the desperado.
			</p>

			  “Excuse me,” he said in a low but determined tone, “I’m a little deaf

			  glorious. Imperial spring is here—the brightest, gayest, and best of

			  its own purity and love not tarnished and seared with the hand of
			  Time. It is like the bright, sparkling miniature rivulet that bursts
			  from the mountain side and goes merrily over the shining pebbles
			  before it hastens into a dark, deep, dangerous river. The sweet
			  cadence of music, the scent of wafted perfumes, the stretch of
			  glorious landscape, radiated and beautified with lovely gems of
			  Oriental hue, catch our attention at every step. The world today is a
			  wilderness of flowers, a bower of beauty, and millions of sweet native
			  warblers make its pastures concert halls, where we can go in peace at
			  even-time, after the strife, the toil, the disappointments, and

			<h3 class="storytitle">A Guess-Proof Mystery Story</h3>

			<p>
			  The most popular and recent advertising dodge in literature is the
			  Grand Guess Contest Mystery Story. Everybody is invited to guess how
			  the story will end, at any time before the last chapter is published,
			  and incidentally to buy a paper or subscribe. It is the easiest thing
			  in the world to write a story of mystery that will defy the most
			  ingenious guessers in the country.
			</p>

			<p>
			  To prove it, here is one that we offer $10,000 to any man and $15,000
			  to any woman who guesses the mystery before the last chapter.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The synopsis of the story is alone given, as literary style is not our
			  object—we want mystery.
			</p>

			<div id="a-guess-proof-mystery-story-1" class="chapter">
				<h4 class="title">Chapter I</h4>

				<p>
				  Judge Smith, a highly esteemed citizen of Plunkville, is found
				  murdered in his bed at his home. He has been stabbed with a pair
				  of scissors, poisoned with “rough on rats.” His throat has been
				  cut with an ivory handled razor, an artery in his arm has been
				  opened, and he has been shot full of buckshot from a
				  double-barreled gun.
				</p>

				<p>
				  The coroner is summoned and the room examined. On the ceiling is a
				  bloody footprint, and on the floor are found a lady’s lace
				  handkerchief, embroidered with the initials “J. B.,” a package of
				  cigarettes and a ham sandwich. The coroner renders a verdict of
				  suicide.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="a-guess-proof-mystery-story-2" class="chapter">
				<h4 class="title">Chapter II</h4>

				<p>
				  The judge leaves a daughter, Mabel, aged eighteen, and ravishingly
				  lovely. The night before the murder she exhibited a revolver and
				  an axe in the principal saloon in town and declared her intention
				  of “doing up” the old man. The judge has his life insured for
				  $100,000 in her favor. Nobody suspects her of the crime.
				</p>

				<p>
				  Mabel is engaged to a young man named Charlie, who is seen on the
				  night of the murder by several citizens climbing out the judge’s
				  window with a bloody razor and a shotgun in his hand. Society
				  gives Charlie the cold shoulder.
				</p>

				<p>
				  A tramp is run over by a street car and before dying confesses to
				  having committed the murder, and at the judge’s funeral his
				  brother, Colonel Smith, breaks down and acknowledges having killed
				  the judge in order to get his watch. Mabel sends to Chicago and
				  employs a skilled detective to work up the case.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="a-guess-proof-mystery-story-3" class="chapter">
				<h4 class="title">Chapter III</h4>

				<p>
				  A beautiful strange lady dressed in mourning comes to Plunkville
				  and registers at the hotel as Jane Bumgartner. (The initials on
				  the handkerchief!)
				</p>

				<p>
				  The next day a Chinaman is found who denies having killed the
				  judge, and is arrested by the detective. The strange lady meets
				  Charlie on the street, and, on smelling the smoke from his
				  cigarette, faints. Mabel discards him and engages herself to the
				  Chinaman.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="a-guess-proof-mystery-story-4" class="chapter">
				<h4 class="title">Chapter IV</h4>

				<p>
				  While the Chinaman is being tried for murder, Jane Bumgartner
				  testifies that she saw the detective murder Judge Smith at the
				  instance of the minister who conducted the funeral, and that Mabel
				  is Charlie’s stepmother. The Chinaman is about to confess when
				  footsteps are heard approaching. The next chapter will be the
				  last, and it is safe to say that no one will find it easy to guess
				  the ending of the story. To show how difficult this feat is, the
				  last chapter is now given.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div id="a-guess-proof-mystery-story-5" class="chapter">
				<h4 class="title">Chapter V</h4>

				<p>
				  The footsteps prove to be those of Thomas R. Hefflebomer of
				  Washington Territory, who introduces positive proof of having
				  murdered the judge during a fit of mental aberration, and Mabel
				  marries a man named Tompkins, whom she met two years later at Hot
				  Springs.

			<p>
			  A party of Northern tourists passed through Houston the other day, and
			  while their train was waiting at the depot an old colored man, with
			  one arm bandaged and hung in an old red handkerchief for a sling,
			  walked along the platform.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What’s the matter with your arm, uncle?” called out one of the
			  tourists.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It was hurt in de wah, sah. Hab you any ’bacco you could gib a po’
			  ole niggah, sah?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Several of the tourists poked their heads out of the car windows to
			  listen, and in a few moments the old darky had taken up a collection
			  in his hat, consisting of a plug of tobacco, three or four cigars, and
			  sundry nickels, dimes, and quarters.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “How were you wounded?” asked a tourist. “Were you shot in the arm?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, sah; hit wusn’t exac’ by a shot.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Piece of shell strike you?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, sah; wusn’t a shell.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Bayonet wound, maybe?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, boss, hit wusn’t a bayonet.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What battle were you in?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Do’ know ef it had a name, but hit was a mighty hot fight while it

			</p>

			<p>
			  “Do you draw a pension?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, boss.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It seems it would be a charitable act,” said a tourist to the others,
			  “to take this old darky’s name and see that he gets the pension he is
			  certainly entitled to. What is your name, uncle?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Mose Atkisson, sah.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Now, Mose,” said the tourist, “give me the particulars of the
			  engagement you were in, and the date, and all the information you
			  possess about the manner in which you were wounded, and the government
			  will pay you a nice little sum every three months to help you along.”
			</p>

			  “Well, I struck a plan once by a sudden inspiration, and it worked

			<p>
			  Street car conductors often have their tempers tried by the
			  inconsiderate portion of the public, but they are not allowed to ease
			  their feelings by “talking back.” One of them related yesterday an
			  occurrence on his line a few days ago.
			</p>

			<p>
			  A very fashionably dressed lady, accompanied by a little boy, was in
			  the car, which was quite full of people. “Conductor,” she said
			  languidly, “let me know when we arrive at Peas Avenue.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  When the car arrived at that street the conductor rang the bell and
			  the car stopped.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Peas Avenue, ma’am,” he said, climbing off to assist her from the
			  car.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The lady raised the little boy to his knees and pointed out the window
			  at the name of the street which was on a board, nailed to the corner
			  of a fence.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Look, Freddy,” she said, “that tall, straight letter with a funny

				<span>Lies settled, and hot white tracery</span>

				<span>Of the shattered sunlight flitters free</span>

			<h3 class="storytitle">The Sunday Excursionist</h3>

			<p>
			  Somebody—who it was doesn’t make any difference—has said something
			  like the following: “There is something grand in the grief of the
			  Common People, but there is no sadder sight on earth than that of a
			  Philistine enjoying himself.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  If a man would realize the truth of this, let him go on a Sunday
			  excursion. The male Sunday excursionist enjoys himself, as the darkies
			  say, “a gwine and a cornin’.” No other being on earth can hold quite
			  so much bubbling and vociferous joy. The welkin that would not ring
			  when the Sunday excursionist opens his escape valve is not worth a
			  cent. Six days the Sunday excursionist labors and does his work, but
			  he does his best to refute the opponents of the theory of the late
			  Charles Darwin. He occupies all the vacant seats in the car with his
			  accomplices, and lets his accursed good nature spray over the rest of
			  the passengers. He is so infernally happy that he wants everybody, to
			  the brakeman on the rear car, to know it. He is so devilish agreeable,
			  so perniciously jolly and so abominably entertaining that people who
			  were bom with or have acquired brains love him most vindictively.
			</p>

			<p>
			  People who become enamored of the Sunday excursionist are apt to grow
			  insanely jealous, and have been known to rise up and murder him when a
			  stranger enters the car and he proceeds to repeat his funny remarks
			  for the benefit of a fresh audience.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The female Sunday excursionist generally accompanies him. She brings
			  her laugh with her, and does a turn in the pauses of his low comedy
			  work. She never by any accident misplaces her laugh or allows it to
			  get out of curl. It ripples naturally and conforms readily to the size
			  of the car. She puts on the male Sunday excursionist’s hat, and he
			  puts on hers, and if the other passengers are feeling worse than
			  usual, they sing “The Swanee River.” There is enough woe and sorrow in
			  the world without augmenting it in this way.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Men who have braved the deepest troubles and emerged unscathed from
			  the heaviest afflictions have gone down with a shriek of horror and
			  despair before the fatal hilarity of the Sunday excursionist. There is
			  no escape from his effects.

		<div id="decoration-day" class="poem">
			<h3 class="storytitle">Decoration Day</h3>

			<p>
			  Decoration Day has passed, and the graves of the Northern and Southern
			  soldiers have been duly flower strewn, as is meet and fitting. The
			  valor of the North has been told on a thousand rostrums, and the
			  courage of the South has been related from ten hundred platforms.
			  Battles have been fought again, and redoubts retaken. Much has been
			  said of brotherly love and the bridging of the chasm. The Blue has
			  marched abreast to the common meeting place, and the Gray has marched
			  abreast, and they have met and shaken hands and said the war is over.
			  There can be no such thing as a union of the Blue and the Gray. When
			  you pronounce the words you form the bar that separates them. The Blue
			  is one thing and the Gray is another. There should be no more Blue and
			  no more Gray. If a tribute is to be paid to the heroes on either side
			  whom we wish to keep in remembrance, it should be made by American
			  citizens, not divided by the colors of their garments. There is no
			  need to march by grand armies, by camps, or by posts. If there is to
			  be a shaking of hands, let it be by one citizen of the United States
			  with another. The Gray and Blue are things of the past. In the
			  innermost hearts, in the still, quick memories of the South, the Gray
			  will always live, but it should live as in a shrine, hallowed and
			  hidden from pomp and display. As citizens of a common country, we of
			  the South offer our hands to citizens of the North in peace and
			  fellowship, but we do not mingle the Gray with the Blue.

			</p>

			<p>
			  “I think so—no, I don’t know; excuse me, please, I’ve got to catch
			  that car.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Hold on, man; great goodness alive, you don’t know what danger you
			  are in. If a sharp particle of the nail gets into your lungs,
			  inflammation is bound to set in, and finally laceration, consumption,
			  hemorrhage, fits, coma, tuberculosis, and death. Think of it! And by
			  the way, a new bacillus has been found in water in which roses have
			  been left standing that is very fatal. I want to warn you. Do you know
			  that—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Say, old man, I’m much obliged, but this letter—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What is a letter compared with your life? There are 10,000,000
			  animalcules in a spoonful of ordinary hydrant water; there are 2,000
			  different varieties known. Do you ever put salt in your beer?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I don’t know; I really must go, I—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Don’t hold me responsible for your life, I’m trying to save it. Why,
			  Heavens, man, it’s nothing but a miracle that we live a single day. In
			  every glass of beer there is an infinitesimal quantity of hydrochloric
			  acid. Salt is a chloride of sodium, and the union releases the
			  chlorine. You are drinking chlorine gas every day of your life. Pause,
			  before it is too late.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I don’t drink beer.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “But you breathe through your mouth when you are asleep. Do you know
			  what that does? Brings on angina pectoris and bronchitis. Are you
			  determined to let your ignorance carry you to your grave? Think of
			  your wife and children! Do you know that the common house fly carries
			  40,000 microbes on his feet, and can convey cholera, typhoid fever,
			  diphtheria, pyaemia, and—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Dang your microbes. I’ve got just three minutes to catch that mail.
			  So long.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Wait just a minute. Dr. Pasteur says that—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  But the victim was gone.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Ten minutes later the heeder of new discoveries was knocked down by a
			  wagon while trying to cross the street reading about a new filter, and
			  was carried home by sympathizing friends.

			  After the performance of “In Old Kentucky” Friday night three old

			</p>

			<p>
			  When they got to feeling a little mellow they sat down at a table and
			  commenced lying. Not maliciously, but just ordinary, friendly lying,
			  about the things they had seen and done. They all tried their hand at
			  relating experiences, and as the sky was clear, there was no matinee

			  Finally the judge suggested the concoction of a fine large julep—a

			  The major and the judge led off with a couple of marvelous narratives

			  rested on the big glass filled with diamonds and amber, and crowned
			  with fragrant mint. He commenced his story:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “The incident I am about to relate is not only wonderful, but true. It
			  happened in this very town on Saturday afternoon. I got up rather
			  early Saturday morning, as I had a big day’s work ahead of me. My wife
			  fixed me up a rattling good cocktail when I got up and I was feeling
			  pretty good. When I came downstairs she handed me a five-dollar bill
			  that had dropped out of my pocket and said: ‘John, you must really get
			  a better looking housemaid. Jane is so homely, and you never did
			  admire her. See if you can find a real nice-looking one—and John,
			  dear, you are working too hard. You must really have some recreation.
			  Why not take Miss Muggins, your typewriter, out for a drive this
			  afternoon? Then you might stop at the milliner’s and tell them not to
			  send up that hat I ordered, and—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Hold on. Colonel,” said the judge. “You just drink that mint julep

			<h3 class="storytitle">An Unsuccessful Experiment</h3>

			<p>
			  There is an old colored preacher in Texas who is a great admirer of
			  the Rev. Sam Jones.<a href="#note-1" id="noteref-1"
			  class="noteref">1</a> Last Sunday he determined to drop his old style
			  of exhorting the brethren, and pitch hot shot plump into the middle of
			  their camp, after the manner so successfully followed by the famous
			  Georgia evangelist. After the opening hymn had been sung, and the
			  congregation led in prayer by a worthy deacon, the old preacher laid
			  his spectacles on his Bible, and let out straight from the shoulder.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “My dearly belubbed,” he said, “I has been preachin’ to you fo’ mo’
			  dan five years, and de grace ob God hab failed to percolate in yo’
			  obstreperous hearts. I hab nebber seen a more or’nery lot dan dis
			  belubbed congregation. Now dar is Sam Wadkins in de fo’th bench on de
			  left. Kin anybody show me a no’counter, trashier, lowdowner buck
			  nigger in dis community? Whar does the chicken feathers come from what
			  I seen in his back yard dis mawnin’? Kin Brudder Wadkins rise and
			  explain?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Brother Wadkins sat in his pew with his eyes rolling and breathing
			  hard, but was taken by surprise and did not respond.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “And dar is Elder Hoskins, on de right. Everybody knows he’s er lying,
			  shiftless, beer-drinking bum. His wife supports him takin’ in washin’.
			  What good is de blood of de Lamb done for him? Wonder ef he thinks dat
			  he kin keep a lofin’ ’round in de kitchen ob de New Jerusalem?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Elder Hoskins, goaded by these charges, rose in his seat, and said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Dat reminds me ob one thing. I doesn’t remember dat I hab ebber
			  worked on de county road fur thirty days down in Bastrop County fur
			  stealin’ a bale of cotton.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Who did? Who did?” said the parson, putting on his specs and glaring
			  at the elder. “Who stole dat cotton? You shet yo’ mouf, niggah, fo’ I
			  come down dah and bust you wide open. Den dar sets Miss Jinny Simpson.
			  Look at dem fine clo’es she got on. Look at dem yallar shoes, and dem
			  ostrick feathers, and dat silk waist and de white glubs. Whar she git
			  de money to buy dem clo’es? She don’t work none. De Lawd am got his
			  eye on dat triflin’ hussy, and He’s gwine ter fling her in de burnin’
			  brimstone and de squenchable pit.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Miss Simpson arose, her ostrich plumes trembling with indignation.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You mis’able lyin’ ol’ niggah,” she said. “You don’ pay fur none ob
			  my clo’es. S’pose you tells dis ’sembled congregation who was it
			  handed dat big bouquet and dat jib ob cider ober de fence to Liza
			  Jackson yisterday mawnin’ when her old man gone to work?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Dat’s a lie, you sneakin’, low-down spyin’ daughter ob de debble. I
			  wuz in my house ras’lin in pra’er fur de wicked sisters and brudders
			  ob dis church. I come down dah an’ smack you in de mouf ef you don’t
			  shet up. You is all boun’ for de fire ob destruction. You am all
			  nothin’ but vile sweepins ob de yearth. I see Bill Rodgers ober dar,
			  who am known to hab loaded dice fur playin’ craps, and he nebber pays
			  a cent fur what his family eats. De Lawd am shore gwine ter smote him
			  in de neck. De judgment ob de Spirit am gwine ter rise up an’ call him
			  down.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Bill Rodgers stood up and put his thumbs in the armholes of his vest.
			  “I could name, sah,” he said, “a certain party who wuz run off ob
			  Colonel Yancy’s fahm fo’ playin’ sebben up wid marked cya’ds, ef I
			  choosed to.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Dat’s anudder lie,” said the preacher, closing his Bible and turning
			  up his cuffs. “Look out, Bill Rodgers, I’m comin’ down dar to you.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The preacher got out of his pulpit and made for Bill, but Miss Simpson
			  got her hands in his wool first, and Sam Wadkins and Elder Hoskins
			  came quickly to her assistance. Then the rest of the brothers and
			  sisters joined in, and the flying hymn books and the sound of ripping
			  clothes testified to the fact that Sam Jones’s style of preaching did
			  not go in that particular church.

			  A man with a very pale face, wearing a woolen comforter and holding a

			  yesterday and leaned against the counter, holding the other hand
			  tightly against his breast.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The clerk got a graduating glass, and poured an ounce of spiritus
			  frumenti into it quickly, and handed it to him. The man drank it at a
			  gulp.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Feel better?” asked the clerk.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “A little. Don’t know when I had such a shock. I can hardly stand.
			  Just a little more, now—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The clerk gave him another ounce of whisky.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “My pulse has started again, I believe,” said the man. “It was
			  terrible, though!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Fell off a wagon?” asked the clerk.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, not exactly.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Slip on a banana peel?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I think not. I’m getting faint again, if you—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The obliging clerk administered a third dose of the stimulant.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Street car run over you?” he asked.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No,” said the pale man. “I’ll tell you how it was. See that red-faced
			  man out there swearing and dancing on the corner?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “He did it. I don’t believe I can stand up much longer. I—thanks.”

			  “No, I guess not. Your kindness has revived me. I’ll tell you about

			<h3 class="storytitle">Speaking of Big Winds</h3>

			<p>
			  The man with the bronzed face and distinguished air was a great
			  traveler, and had just returned from a tour around the world. He sat
			  around the stove at the Lamlor, and four or five drummers and men
			  about town listened with much interest to his tales.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He was speaking of the fierce wind storms that occur in South America,
			  when the long grass of the pampas is interlaced and blown so flat by
			  the hurricanes that it is cut into strips and sold for the finest
			  straw matting.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He spoke also of the great intelligence of the wild cattle which, he
			  said, although blown about by the furious hurricanes and compelled to
			  drift for days before the drenching floods of the rainy season, never
			  lost their direction by day or night.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “How do they guide themselves?” asked the Topeka flour drummer.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Oh, by their udders, of course,” said the traveler.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I don’t see anything to laugh about,” said the Kansas man, “but
			  speaking of big winds we have something of the kind in our state.
			  You’ve all heard of the Kansas cyclones, but very few of you know what
			  they are. We have plenty of them and some are pretty hard ones, too,
			  but most of the stories you read about them are exaggerated. Still a
			  good, full-grown cyclone can carry things pretty high sometimes. About
			  the only thing they spend their fury upon in vain is a real estate
			  agent. I know a fellow, named Bob Long, who was a real estate hustler
			  from away back. Bob had bought up a lot of prairie land cheap, and was
			  trying to sell it in small tracts for farms and truck patches. One day
			  he took a man in his buggy out to this land and was showing it to him.
			  ‘Just look at it,’ he said. ‘It is the finest, richest piece of ground
			  in Kansas. Now it’s worth more, but to start things off, and get
			  improvements to going, I’ll sell you 160 acres of this land at $40
			  per—!’
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Before Bob could say ‘acre,’ a cyclone came along, and the edge of it
			  took Bob up straight into the air. He went up till he was nothing but
			  a black speck and the man stood there and watched him till he was out
			  of sight.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “The man liked the land, so he bought it from Bob’s heirs, and pretty
			  soon a railroad cut across it, and a fine flourishing town sprang up
			  on the spot.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Well, this man was standing on the sidewalk one day thinking of how
			  lucky he had been, and about Bob’s unfortunate fate, when he happened
			  to look up and saw something falling. It grew larger and larger, and
			  finally it turned out to be a man.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “He came tumbling down, struck the sidewalk with a sound you could
			  have heard four blocks away, bounded up at least ten feet, came down
			  on his feet and shouted ‘Front foot!’
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It was Bob Long. His beard was a little grayer and longer, but he was
			  all business still. He had noticed the changes that had taken place
			  while he was coming down, and when he finished the sentence that he
			  began when the cyclone took him up, he altered his language
			  accordingly. Bob was a hustler. Sometime after that he—”
			</p>

			  “Never mind,” said the traveler. “Let’s go in and take something on
			  this one first. I claim the usual time before the next round.”

			<h3 class="storytitle">An Original Idea</h3>

			<p>
			  There is a lady in Houston who is always having original ideas.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Now, this is a very reprehensible thing in a woman and should be
			  frowned down. A woman should find out what her husband thinks about
			  everything and regulate her thoughts to conform with his. Of course,
			  it would not be so bad if she would keep her independent ideas to
			  herself, but who ever knew a woman to do that?
			</p>

			<p>
			  This lady in particular had a way of applying her original ideas to
			  practical use, and her family, and even neighbors, were kept
			  constantly on the lookout for something startling at her hands.
			</p>

			<p>
			  One day she read in the columns of an Austin newspaper an article that
			  caused her at once to conceive an original idea. The article called
			  attention to the well-known fact that if men’s homes supplied their
			  wants and desires they would have no propensity to wander abroad,
			  seeking distraction in gilded saloons. This struck the lady as a
			  forcible truth, and she boldly plagiarized the idea and resolved to
			  put it into immediate execution as an original invention.
			</p>

			<p>
			  That night when her husband came home he noticed a curtain stretched
			  across one end of the sitting room, but he had so long been used to
			  innovations of all sorts that he was rather afraid to investigate.
			</p>

			<p>
			  It might be stated apropos to the story that the lady’s husband was
			  addicted to the use of beer.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He not only liked beer, but he fondly loved beer. Beer never felt the
			  slightest jealousy when this gentleman was out of its sight.
			</p>

			<p>
			  After supper the lady said: “Now, Robert, I have a little surprise for
			  you. There is no need of your going downtown tonight, as you generally
			  do, because I have arranged our home so that it will supply all the
			  pleasures that you go out to seek.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  With that she drew the curtain and Robert saw that one end of the
			  sitting room had been fitted up as a bar—or rather his wife’s idea of
			  a bar.
			</p>

			<p>
			  A couple of strips of the carpet had been taken up and sawdust strewn
			  on the floor. The kitchen table extended across the end of the room,
			  and back of this on a shelf were arranged a formidable display of
			  bottles, of all shapes and sizes, while the mirror of the best dresser
			  had been taken off and placed artistically in the center.
			</p>

			<p>
			  On a trestle stood a fresh keg of beer and his wife, who had put on a
			  coquettish-looking cap and apron, tripped lightly behind the bar, and
			  waving a beer mug coyly at him said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It’s an idea I had, Robert. I thought it would be much nicer to have
			  you spend your money at home, and at the same time have all the
			  amusement and pleasure that you do downtown. What will you have, sir?”
			  she continued, with fine, commercial politeness.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Robert leaned against the bar and pawed the floor fruitlessly three or
			  four times, trying to find the foot rest. He was a little stunned, as
			  he always was at his wife’s original ideas. Then he braced himself and
			  tried to conjure up a ghastly imitation of a smile.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I’ll take a beer, please,” he said.
			</p>

			<p>
			  His wife drew the beer, laid the nickel on the shelf and leaned on the
			  bar, chatting familiarly on the topics of the day after the manner of
			  bartenders.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You must buy plenty, now,” she said archly, “for you are the only
			  customer I have tonight.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Robert felt a strong oppression of spirits, which he tried to hide.
			  Besides the beer, which was first rate, there was little to remind him
			  of the saloons where he had heretofore spent his money.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The lights, the glittering array of crystal, the rattle of dice, the
			  funny stories of Brown, Jones, and Robinson, the motion and color that
			  he found in the other places were wanting.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Robert stood still for quite a while and then an original idea struck
			  him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He pulled a handful of change from his pocket and began to call for
			  glass after glass of beer. The lady behind the bar was beaming with
			  pleasure at the success of her experiment. Ordinarily she had made
			  quite a row, if her husband came home smelling of beer—but now, when
			  the profits were falling into her own hands, she made no complaint.
			</p>

			<p>
			  It is not known how many glasses she sold her husband but there was
			  quite a little pile of nickels and dimes on the shelf, and two or
			  three quarters.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Robert was leaning rather heavily against the bar, now and then
			  raising his foot and making a dab for the rod that was not there, but
			  he was saying very little. His wife ought to have known better, but
			  the profits rendered her indiscreet.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Presently Robert remarked in a very loud tone:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Gozzamighty, se’ ’m up all roun’ barkeep’n puzzom on slate ’m
			  busted.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  His wife looked at him in surprise.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Indeed, I will not, Robert,” she said. “You must pay me for
			  everything you have. I thought you understood that.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Robert looked in the mirror as straight as he could, counted his
			  reflections, and then yelled loud enough to be heard a block away:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Gosh dang it, gi’ us six glasses beer and put ’em on ice, Susie, old
			  girl, or I’ll clean out your joint, ’n bus’ up business. Whoopee!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Robert!” said his wife, in a tone implying a growing suspicion,
			  “you’ve been drinking!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Zas d——d lie!” said Robert, as he threw a beer glass through the
			  mirror. “Been down t’ office helpin’ friend pos’ up books ’n missed
			  last car. Say, now, Susie, old girl, you owe me two beers from las’
			  time. Give ’em to me or I’ll kick down bar.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Robert’s wife was named Henrietta. When he made this remark she came
			  around to the front and struck him over the eye with a lemon squeezer.
			  Robert then kicked over the table, broke about half the bottles,
			  spilled the beer, and used language not suited for the mailable
			  edition.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Ten minutes later his wife had him tied with the clothes line, and
			  during the intervals between pounding him on the head with a potato
			  masher she was trying to think how to get rid of her last great
			  original idea.

			  A gentleman with long hair and an expression indicating heavenly
			  resignation stepped off the twelve-thirty train at the Grand Central
			  Depot yesterday. He had a little bunch of temperance tracts in his
			  hand, and he struck a strong scent and followed it up to a red-nosed
			  individual who was leaning on a trunk near the baggage room.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “My friend,” said the long-haired man, “do you know that if you had
			  placed the price of three drinks out at compound interest at the time
			  of the building of Solomon’s temple, you would now have
			  $47,998,645.22?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I do,” said the red-nosed man. “I am something of a calculator
			  myself. I also figured out when the doctor insisted on painting my
			  nose with iodine to cure that boil, that the first lanternjawed,
			  bone-spavined, rubbernecked son-of-a-gun from the amen corner of
			  Meddlesome County that made any remarks about it would have to jump
			  seventeen feet in nine seconds or get kicked thirteen times below the
			  belt. You have just four seconds left.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The long-haired man made a brilliant retreat within his allotted time,
			  and bore down with his temperance tracts upon a suspicious-looking
			  Houston man who was carrying home a bottle of mineral water wrapped in
			  a newspaper to his mother-in-law.

			  Brother, you should not have given us away. We just had to salt that
			  vein before we could get it in the market, and when the “salt” gave
			  out, and the end of the vein was reached, we hoped you wouldn’t notice
			  the fact. If you hadn’t mentioned it we might have gone on for years
			  gladdening and instructing and drawing princely salary, but now our
			  little spurt of our brilliancy will have to put on its pajamas and
			  retire between the cold sheets of oblivion. We do not blame you at all
			  for calling the public’s attention to the played-out lode, for it is a
			  terrible responsibility to guide the footsteps of innocent purchasers
			  who may be taken in by glittering, quartz and seductive pyrites of
			  iron. To have one whom we regarded as a friend jerk us backward by the

			  scramble over the back fence of the temple of fame makes us sad, but

			  The golden crescent of the new moon hung above the market house, and
			  the night was cool, springlike, and perfect.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Five or six men were sitting in front of the Hutchins House, and they
			  had gradually shifted their chairs until they were almost in a group.
			</p>

			<p>
			  They were men from different parts of the country, some of them from
			  cities thousands of miles away. They had been rattled in the dice box
			  of chance and thrown in a temporary cluster into the hospitable gates
			  of the Magnolia city.
			</p>

			<p>
			  They smoked and talked, and that feeling of comradeship which seizes
			  men who meet in the world far from their own homes, was strong upon
			  them.
			</p>

			<p>
			  They told all their funny stories and compared experiences, and then a
			  little silence fell upon them, and while the hanging strata of blue
			  smoke grew thicker, their thoughts began to wander back—as the cows
			  stray homeward at eventide—to other scenes and faces.

			<p>
			  “Same here,” said the little man from St. Louis. “I can just see the

			  puts them to bed. There’s one blessing, though, I’ll be home on
			  Thanksgiving.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I had a letter from home today,” said the white-bearded
			  Philadelphian, “and it made me homesick. I would give a foot of that
			  slushy pavement on Spruce Street for all these balmy airs and
			  mockingbird solos in the South. I’m going to strike a bee line for the

			<p>
			  “The worst part of it is,” said the man with the gold nose glasses and
			  green necktie, “that our dear ones are separated from us by many long
			  and dreary miles, and we little know what obstacles in the shape of
			  storm and flood and wreck lie in our way. If we could but annihilate
			  time and space for a brief interval there are many of us who would

			<p>
			  “That breeze,” said the man from New York, “feels exactly like the
			  ones that used to blow over the old farm in Montgomery County, and
			  that ‘orchard and meadow, and deep tangled wildwood,’ etc., keep
			  bobbing up in my memory tonight.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “How many of us,” said the man with gold glasses, “realize the many
			  pitfalls that Fate digs in our path? What a slight thing may sever the
			  cord that binds us to life! There today, tomorrow gone forever from
			  the world!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Too true,” said the Philadelphia man, wiping his spectacles.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “And leave those we love behind,” continued the other. “The affections
			  of a lifetime, the love of the strongest hearts, ended in the
			  twinkling of an eye. One loses the clasp of hands that would detain
			  and drifts away into the sad, unknowable, other existence, leaving
			  aching hearts to mourn forever. Life seems all a tragedy.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Banged if you ain’t rung the bell first shot,” said the Chicago
			  drummer. “Our affections get busted up something worse’n killing
			  hogs.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The others frowned upon the Chicago drummer, for the man with gold
			  glasses was about to speak again.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “We say,” he went on, “that love will live forever, and yet when we
			  are gone others step into our places and the wounds our loss had made
			  are healed. And yet there is an added pang to death that those of us
			  that are wise can avoid, the sting of death and the victory of the

			  “Charlie,” she said, presently, “you must begin to realize that you
			  must economize and lay aside something each month for the future. You
			  must realize that the new addition to our home that will bring us joy
			  arid pleasure and make sweet music around our fireside must be
			  provided for. You must be ready to meet the obligations that will be
			  imposed upon you, and remember that another than ourselves must be

			  we shall be held to account for our trust here below. Do you realize
			  the responsibility?”
			</p>

			  Charlie said “Yes,” and then went out in the woodshed and muttered to
			  himself: “I wonder whether she was talking about the kid, or means to
			  buy a piano on the installment plan.”

			<p>
			  A weary-looking man with dejected auburn whiskers, walked into the
			  police station yesterday afternoon and said to the officer in charge:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I want to give myself up. I expect you had better handcuff me and put
			  me into a real dark cell where there are plenty of spiders and mice.
			  I’m one of the worst men you ever saw, and I waive trial. Please tell
			  the jailer to give me moldy bread to eat, and hydrant water with
			  plenty of sulphur in it.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What have you done?” asked the officer.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I’m a miserable, low-down, lying, good-for-nothing, slandering,
			  drunken, villainous, sacrilegious galoot, and I’m not fit to die. You
			  might ask the jailer, also, to bring little boys in to look at me
			  through the bars, while I gnash my teeth and curse in demoniac rage.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “We can’t put you in jail unless you have committed some offense.
			  Can’t you bring some more specific charge against yourself?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, I just want to give myself up on general principles. You see, I
			  went to hear Sam Jones last night, and he saw me in the crowd and
			  diagnosed my case to a <i>T</i>. Up to that time I thought I was a
			  four-horse team with a yellow dog under the wagon, but Sam took the
			  negative side and won. I’m a danged old sore-eyed hound dog; I
			  wouldn’t mind if you kicked me a few times before you locked me up,
			  and sent my wife word that the old villain that has been abusin’ her
			  for twenty years has met his deserts.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Aw, come now,” said the officer, “I don’t believe you are as bad as
			  you think you are. You don’t know that Sam Jones was talking about you
			  at all. It might have been somebody else he was hitting. Brace up and
			  don’t let it worry you.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Lemme see,” said the weary-looking man reflectively. “Come to think
			  of it there was one of my neighbors sitting right behind me who is the
			  meanest man in Houston. He is a mangy pup, and no mistake. He beats
			  his wife and has refused to loan me three dollars five different
			  times. What Sam said just fits his case exactly. If I thought now—”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “That’s the way to look at it,” said the officer. “The chances are Sam
			  wasn’t thinking about you at all.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Durned if I believe he was, now I remember about that neighbor of
			  mine,” said the penitent, beginning to brighten up. “You don’t know
			  what a weight you’ve taken off my mind. I was just feeling like I was
			  one of the worst sinners in the world. I’ll bet any man ten dollars he
			  was talking right straight at that miserable, contemptible scalawag
			  that sat right behind me. Say, come on and let’s go out and take
			  somethin’, will you?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The officer declined and the weary-looking man ran his finger down his
			  neck and pulled his collar up into sight and said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I’ll never forget your kindness, sir, in helping me out of this
			  worry. It has made me feel bad all day. I am going out to the
			  racetrack now, and take the field against the favorite for a few
			  plunks. Good day, I shall always remember your kindness.”

			  There was something the matter with the electric lights Tuesday night,

			  situation, and were holding as close a session as possible.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Presently she said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “George, I know you love me, and I am sure that nothing in the world

			<p>
			  “What is it, my darling?” asked George, in an agony of suspense.
			  “Speak, my own, and tell me what it is that has come between you and

			  “I think, George” she softly sighed, “it is your watch.”

			<p>
			  A stranger walked into a Houston bank the other day and presented a
			  draft to the cashier for payment.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You will have to be identified,” said the cashier, “by someone who
			  knows your name to be Henry B. Saunders.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “But I don’t know anybody in Houston,” said the stranger. “Here’s a
			  lot of letters addressed to me, and a telegram from my firm, and a lot
			  of business cards. Won’t they be identification enough?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I am sorry,” said the cashier, “but while I have no doubt that you
			  are the party, our rule is to require better identification.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The man unbuttoned his vest and showed the initial, H. B. S., on his
			  shirt. “Does that go?” he asked. The cashier shook his head. “You
			  might have Henry B. Saunders’ letters, and his papers, and also his
			  shirt on, without being the right man. We are forced to be very
			  careful.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The stranger tore open his shirt front, and exhibited a large mustard
			  plaster, covering his entire chest. “There,” he shouted, “if I wasn’t
			  Henry B. Saunders, do you suppose I would go around wearing one of his
			  mustard plasters stuck all over me? Do you think I would carry my
			  impersonation of anybody far enough to blister myself to look like

			</p>

			<p>
			  The cashier hesitated and then shoved out the money. After the

			<h3 class="storytitle">The Apple</h3>

			<p>
			  A youth held in his hand a round, red, luscious apple.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Eat,” said the Spirit, “it is the apple of life.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I will have none of it,” said the Youth, and threw it far from him.
			  “I will have success. I will have fame, fortune, power and knowledge.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Come, then,” said the Spirit.
			</p>

			<p>
			  They went together up steep and rocky paths. The sun scorched, the
			  rain fell upon them, the mountain mists clung about them, and the snow
			  fell in beautiful and treacherous softness, obscuring the way as they
			  climbed. Time swiftly passed and the golden locks of the Youth took on
			  the whiteness of the snow. His form grew bent with the toil of
			  climbing; his hand grew weak and his voice quivering and high.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The Spirit had not changed and upon his face was the inscrutable smile
			  of wisdom.
			</p>

			<p>
			  They stood at last upon the topmost peak. The old man that was the
			  Youth said to the Spirit: “Give me the apple of Success. I have come
			  upon the heights where it grows and it is mine. Be quick, for there is
			  a strange dimness in my sight.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The Spirit gave him an apple round and red and fair to behold.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The man bit into it and found rottenness and bitter dust.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What is this?” he asked.

		<div id="how-it-started" class="story">
			<h3 class="storytitle">How It Started</h3>

			<p>
			  “You had better move your chair a little further back,” said the old
			  resident. “I saw one of the Judkinses go into the newspaper office
			  just now with his gun, and there may be some shooting.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The reporter, who was in the town gathering information for the big
			  edition, got his chair quickly behind a pillar of the hotel piazza,
			  and asked what the trouble was about.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It’s an old feud of several years’ standing,” said the old resident,
			  “between the editor and the Judkins family. About every two months
			  they get to shooting at one another. Everybody in town knows about it.
			  This is the way it started. The Judkinses live in another town, and
			  one time a good-looking young lady of the family came here on a visit
			  to a Mrs. Brown. Mrs. Brown gave her a big party—a regular high-toned
			  affair, to get the young men acquainted with her. One young fellow
			  fell in love with her, and sent a little poem to our paper, the
			  <i>Observer</i>. This is the way it read:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<div class="header">
					<p>To <b>Miss Judkins</b><br/>
					(Visiting Mrs. T. Montcalm Brown.)</p>
				</div>

				<p>
					<span>“We love to see her wear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A gown of simple white.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing but a rose in her hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At Mrs. Brown’s that night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fairest of them all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She stood, with blushes red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While bright the gaslight shone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon her lovely head.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  “That poem, now, was what started the feud.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I don’t see anything wrong with the poem,” said the reporter. “It
			  seems a little crude, but contains nothing to give offense.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Well,” said the old resident, “the poem was all right as it was
			  written. The trouble originated in the newspaper office. The morning
			  after it was sent in the society editress got hold of it first. She is
			  an old maid and she didn’t think the second line quite proper, so she
			  ran her pencil through it. Then the advertising manager prowled around
			  through the editor’s mail as usual, and read the poem. Old Brown owed
			  the office $17 back subscription, and the advertising manager struck
			  out the fourth line. He said old Brown shouldn’t get any free
			  advertising in that office.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Then the editor’s wife happened to come in to see if there was any
			  square, perfumed envelopes among his mail, and she read it. She was at
			  the Brown’s party herself, and when she read the line that proclaimed
			  Miss Judkins ‘The fairest of them all’ she turned up her nose and
			  scratched that out.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Then the editor himself got hold of it. He is heavily interested in
			  our new electric light plant, and his blue pencil jumped on the line
			  ‘While bright the gaslight shone’ in a hurry. Later on one of the
			  printers came in and grabbed a lot of copy, and this poem was among
			  it. You know what printers will do if you give them a chance, so here
			  is the way the poem came out in the paper:
			</p>

			<blockquote class="poem">
				<div class="header"> To <b>Miss Judkins</b><br/>

			  They were speaking of the power of great orators, and each one had
			  something to say of his especial favorite.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The drummer was for backing Bourke Cockran for oratory against the
			  world, the young lawyer thought the suave Ingersoll the most
			  persuasive pleader, and the insurance agent advanced the claims of the
			  magnetic W. C. P. Breckenridge.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “They all talk some,” said the old cattle man, who was puffing his
			  pipe and listening, “but they couldn’t hold a candle to Red Conlin,
			  that run cattle below Santone in ’80. Ever know Red?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  Nobody had had the honor.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Red Conlin was a natural orator; he wasn’t overcrowded with book
			  learnin’, but his words come free and easy, like whisky out of a new
			  faucet from a full barrel. He was always in a good humor and smilin’
			  clear across his face, and if he asked for a hot biscuit he did it
			  like he was pleadin’ for his life. He was one man who had the gift of
			  gab, and it never failed him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I remember once, in Atascosa County, the hoss thieves worried us
			  right smart. There was a gang of ’em, and they got runnin’ off a
			  caballaro every week or so. Some of us got together and raised a p’int
			  of order and concluded to sustain it. The head of the gang was a
			  fellow named Mullens, and a tough cuss he was. Fight, too, and warn’t
			  particular when. Twenty of us saddled up and went into camp, loaded
			  down with six-shooters and Winchesters. That Mullens had the nerve to
			  try to cut off our saddle horses the first night, but we heard him,
			  got mounted, and went hot on his trail. There was five or six others
			  with Mullens.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It was dark as thunder, and pretty soon we run one of them down. His
			  horse was lame, and we knew it was Mullens by his big white hat and
			  black beard. We didn’t hardly give him time to speak, we was so mad,
			  but in two minutes there was a rope ’round his neck and Mullens was
			  swung up at last. We waited about ten minutes till he was still, and
			  then some fellow strikes a match out of curiosity and screeches out:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “ ‘Gosh a’mighty, boys, we’ve strung up the wrong man!”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “And we had.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “We reopened the fellow’s case and give him a new trial, and acquitted
			  him, but it was too late to do him any good. He was as dead as Davy
			  Crockett.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It was Sandy McNeagh, one of the quietest, straightest, and
			  best-respected men in the county, and what was worse, hadn’t been
			  married but about three months.

			<p>
			  “ ‘Whatever are we to do?’ says I, and it sure was a case to think
			  about.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “ ‘We ought to be nigh Sandy’s house now,’ said one of the men, who
			  was tryin’ to peer around and kind of locate the scene of our
			  brilliant coop detaw, as they say.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Just then we seen a light from a door that opened in the dark, and
			  the house wasn’t two hundred yards away, and we saw what we knew must
			  be Sandy’s wife in the door a-lookin’ for him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “ ‘Somebody’s got to go and tell her,’ said I. I was kind o’ leadin’
			  the boys. ‘Who’ll do it?’ Nobody jumped at the proposition.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “ ‘Red Conlin’ says I, ‘you’re the man to tell her, and the only man
			  here what could open his mouth to the poor girl. Go, like a man, and
			  may the Lord teach you what to say, for d——d if I can.’
			</p>

			<p>
			  “That boy never hesitated. I saw him kind o’ wet his hand, and smooth
			  back his red curls in the dark, and I seen his teeth shinin’ as he
			  said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “ ‘I’ll go, boys; wait for me.’

			<p>
			  “He went and we saw the door open and let him in.

			  A man with a worn, haggard countenance that showed traces of deep
			  sorrow and suffering rushed excitedly up the stairs into the editorial
			  rooms of the Post.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The literary editor was alone in his corner and the man threw himself
			  into a chair nearby and said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Excuse me, sir, for inflicting my troubles upon you, but I must
			  unbosom myself to someone. I am the unhappiest of men. Two months ago,
			  in a quiet little town in Eastern Texas, there was a family dwelling
			  in the midst of peace and contentment. Hezekiah Skinner was the head
			  of that family, and he almost idolized his wife, who appeared to
			  completely return his affection. Alas, sir, she was deceiving him. Her
			  protestations of love were but honeyed lies, intended to beguile and
			  blind him. She had become infatuated with William Wagstaff, a
			  neighbor, who had insidiously planned to capture her affections. She
			  listened to Wagstaff’s pleadings and fled with him, leaving her
			  husband with a wrecked home and a broken heart. Can you not feel for
			  me, sir?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I do, indeed,” said the literary editor. “I can conceive the agony,
			  the sorrow, the deep suffering that you must have felt.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “For two months,” continued the man, “the home of Hezekiah Skinner has
			  been desolate, and this woman and Wagstaff have been flying from his
			  wrath.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What do you intend to do?” asked the literary editor.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I scarcely know. I do not care for the woman any longer, but I cannot
			  escape the tortures my mind is undergoing day after day.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  At this point a shrill woman’s voice was heard in the outer office,
			  making some inquiry of the office boy.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Great heavens, her voice!” said the man, rising to his feet greatly
			  agitated. “I must get out of here. Quick! Is there no way for me to
			  escape? A window—a side door—anywhere before she finds me.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The literary editor rose with indignation in his face.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “For shame, sir,” he said, “do not act so unworthy a part. Confront
			  your faithless wife, Mr. Skinner, and denounce her for wrecking your
			  life and home. Why do you hesitate to stand up for your honor and your
			  rights?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “You do not understand,” said the man, his face white with fear and
			  apprehension, as he climbed out the window upon a shed. “I am William

			  Two men went into a saloon on Main Street yesterday and braced up

			  farm hands and they appeared somewhat bewildered at the splendor of
			  the saloon.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The bartender asked them what they would have.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The old man leaned across the bar and said hoarsely and mysteriously:
			  “You see, mister, me an’ Lem just sold a load of tomatters and green
			  corn fer nineteen dollars en a half. The old woman at home figgered
			  we’d git just sixteen dollars and a quarter fer the truck, so me and

			  it?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Some think so,” said the bartender, “what’ll you have?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  They both called for whisky and stood against the bar until they had
			  taken some five or six drinks apiece.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Feel good, Lem?” asked the old man.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Not a dam bit,” said the son.

			<p>
			  “Don’t feel like shoutin’ and raisin’ Cain?”

			<p>
			  “No.”

			  There is one man we know who is about as clever a reasoner as this
			  country has yet produced. He has a way of thinking out a problem that
			  is sometimes little short of divination. One day last week his wife
			  told him to make some purchases, and as with all his logical powers he
			  is rather forgetful on ordinary subjects, she tied a string around his
			  finger so he would not forget his errand. About nine o’clock that
			  night while hurrying homeward, he suddenly felt the string on his
			  finger and stopped short. Then for the life of him he could not
			  remember for what purpose the string had been placed there.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Let’s see,” he said. “The string was tied on my finger so I would not
			  forget. Therefore it is a forget-me-not. Now forget-me-not is a
			  flower. Ah, yes, that’s it. I was to get a sack of flour.”

			<p>
			  He is dead and I killed him.
			</p>

			<p>
			  I gaze upon him, lying cold and still, with the crimson blood welling
			  from his wound, and I laugh with joy. On my hand his life blood leaped
			  and I hold it proudly aloft bearing it accusing stain and in my heart
			  there is no pity, no remorse, no softness. Seeing him lie there
			  crushed and pulseless is to me more than the pleasure of paradise. For
			  months he escaped me. With all the intense hate I bore him at times, I
			  felt admiration for his marvelous courage, his brazen effrontery, his
			  absolute ignorance of fear. Why did I kill him? Because he had with a
			  fixed purpose and a diabolical, persistent effrontery, conspired to
			  rob me of that which is as dear to me as my life. Brave as I have said
			  he was, he scarcely dared to cross my path openly, but with insidious
			  cunning had ever sought to strike me a blow in the dark.
			</p>

			<p>
			  I did not fear him, but I knew his power, and I dared not give him his
			  opportunity.
			</p>

			<p>
			  Many a sleepless night I have spent, planning some means to rid myself
			  of his devilish machinations. He even attempted to torture me by
			  seeking to harm her whom I love. He approached herewith the utmost
			  care and cunning, wearing the guise of a friend, but striving to
			  instill his poison into her innocent heart.
			</p>

			<p>
			  But, thank heaven, she was faithful and true and his honeyed songs and
			  wiles had no effect. When she would tell me of his approaches, how I
			  would grind my teeth and clench my hands in fury, and long for the
			  time when I would wreak a just vengeance upon him. The time has come.
			  I found him worn and helpless from cold and hunger, but there was no
			  pity in my heart. I struck him down and reveled with heartfelt joy
			  when I saw him sink down, bathed in blood, and die by my hands. I do
			  not fear the consequences. When I tell my tale I will be upheld by
			  all.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He is dead and I am satisfied.
			</p>

			<p>
			  I think he is the largest and fattest mosquito I ever saw.

			  He was tall and angular and had a keen gray eye and a solemn face. His
			  dark coat was buttoned high and had something of a clerical cut. His
			  pepper and salt trousers almost cleared the tops of his shoes, but his
			  tall hat was undeniably respectable, and one would have said he was a
			  country preacher out for a holiday. He was driving a light wagon, and
			  he stopped and climbed out when he came up to where five or six men
			  were sitting on the post-office porch in a little country town in
			  Texas.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “My friends,” he said, “you all look like intelligent men, and I feel

			  deplorable state of things now existing in this section of the
			  country. I refer to the horrible barbarities recently perpetrated in
			  the midst of some of the most civilized of Texas towns, when human
			  beings created in the image of their Maker were subjected to cruel
			  torture and then inhumanly burned in the public streets. Something
			  must be done to wipe the stigma from the fair name of your state. Do
			  you not agree with me?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Are you from Galveston, stranger?” asked one of the men.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, sir. I am from Massachusetts, the cradle of liberty of the

			  burnings are causing us to weep tears of blood and I am here to see if
			  I can not move your hearts to pity on his behalf.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I guess you might as well drive on,” said one of the group. “We are

			<p>
			  They were sitting around a stove and the tobacco was passed around.
			  They began to grow introspective.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The talk turned upon their old homes and the changes that the cycling
			  years bring about. They had lived in Houston for many years, but only
			  one was a native Texan.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The colonel hailed from Alabama, the judge was born in the swamps of
			  Mississippi, the grocer first saw the light in a frozen town of Maine,
			  and the major proudly claimed Tennessee as his birthplace.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Have any of you fellows been back home since you left there?” asked
			  the colonel.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The judge had been back twice in twenty years, the major once, the
			  grocer never.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It’s a curious feeling,” said the colonel, “to go back to the old
			  home where you were raised, after an absence of fifteen years. It is
			  like seeing ghosts to be among people whom you have not seen in so
			  long a time. Now I went back to Crosstree, Alabama, just fifteen years
			  after I left there. The impression made upon me was one that never
			  will be obliterated.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “There was a girl in Crosstree once that I loved better than anything
			  in the world. One day I slipped away from everybody and went down to
			  the little grove where I used to walk with her. I walked along the
			  paths we used to tread. The oaks along the side had scarcely changed;
			  the little blue flowers on either hand might have been the same ones
			  she used to twine in her hair when she came to meet me.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Our favorite walk had been along a line of thick laurels beyond which
			  ran a little stream. Everything was the same. There was no change
			  there to oppress my heart. Above were the same great sycamores and
			  poplars; there ran the same brook; my feet trod the same path they had
			  so often walked with her. It seemed that if I waited she would surely
			  come again, tripping so lightly through the gloaming with her starry
			  eyes, and nut-brown curls, and she loved me, too. It seemed then that
			  nothing could ever have parted us—no doubt, no misunderstanding, no
			  falsehood. But who can tell?
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I went to the end of the path. There stood the old hollow tree in
			  which we used to place notes to each other. What sweet words that old
			  tree could tell if it had known! I had fancied that during the rubs
			  and knocks I had received from the world my heart had grown calloused,
			  but such was not the case.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “I looked down into the hollow of the tree, and saw something white.
			  It was a folded piece of paper, yellow and stained with age. I opened
			  it and read it with difficulty.
			</p>

			<blockquote class="letter">
				<p>
				  “ ‘Dearest Richard: You know I will marry you if you want
				  me to. Come round early tonight and I will give you my
				  answer in a better way. Your own Nellie.’
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
			  “Gentlemen, I stood there holding that little piece of paper in my
			  hand like one in a dream. I had written her a note asking her to marry
			  me and telling her to leave her answer in the old tree. She must have
			  done so, and I never got it, and all those years had rolled away
			  since.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The crowd was silent. The major wiped his eyes, and the judge sniffed
			  a little. They were middle-aged men now, but they, too, had known
			  love.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “And then,” said the grocer, “you left right away for Texas and never
			  saw her again?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No,” said the colonel. “When I didn’t come round that night she sent
			  her father after me, and we were married two months later. She and the
			  five kids are up at the house now. Pass the tobacco, please.”

			<h3 class="storytitle">A Narrow Escape</h3>

			<p>
			  A meek-looking man, with one eye and a timid, shuffling gait, entered
			  a Houston saloon while no one was in except the bartender, and said:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Excuse me, sir, but would you permit me to step behind the bar for
			  just a moment? You can keep your eye on me. There is something there I
			  wanted to look at.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The bartender was not busy, and humored him through curiosity.
			</p>

			<p>
			  The meek-looking man stepped around and toward the shelf back of the
			  bar.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Would you kindly remove that wine bottle and those glasses for a
			  moment?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The bartender did so, and disclosed a little plowed streak on the
			  shelf and a small hole bored for quite a distance into the wall.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Thanks, that’s all,” said the meek man, as he went around to the
			  front again.
			</p>

			<p>
			  He leaned thoughtfully on the bar and said: “I shot that hole in there
			  just nine years ago. I came in feeling pretty thirsty and had no
			  money. The bartender refused me a drink and I commenced firing. That
			  ball went through his ear and five bottles of champagne before it
			  stopped. I then yelled quite loudly, and two men broke their arms
			  trying to get out the door, and the bartender trembled so when he
			  mixed a drink for me you would have thought he was putting up a milk
			  shake for a girl who wanted to catch a street car.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes?” said the bartender.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes, sir, I am feeling a little out of sorts today, and it always
			  makes me real cross and impatient when I get that way. A little gin
			  and bitters always helps me. It was six times, I think, that I fired,
			  the time I was telling you about. Straight whisky would do if the gin
			  is out.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “If I had any fly paper,” said the bartender, sweetly, “I would stick
			  you on it and set you in the back window; but I am out, consequently,
			  I shall have to adopt harsher measures. I shall tie a knot in this
			  towel, and then count ten, and walk around the end of the bar. That
			  will give you time to do your shooting, and I’ll see that you let out
			  that same old yell that you spoke of.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Wait a moment,” said the meek man. “Come to think of it, my doctor
			  ordered me not to drink anything for six weeks. But you had a narrow
			  escape all the same. I think I shall go down to the next drug store
			  and fall in a fit on the sidewalk. That’s good for some peppermint and
			  aromatic spirits of ammonia, anyhow.”

			  approached and touched her on the shoulder.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “What is your name, little girl?” he asked.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Susie Tompkins, sir,” she answered, looking up at him with great,

			</p>

			<p>
			  There was something in her pleading, innocent voice that stirred a
			  strange feeling in the millionaire’s heart. Still it may have been
			  indigestion.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Have you a father?” he asked.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Oh, no, sir, mother has only me to support.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Is your mother very poor?”
			</p>

			</p>

			<p>
			  “Susan, sir. Just like mine.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Tell me, child,” said the wealthy man, clutching her arm in an agony
			  of suspense. “Has your mother a wart on her nose, and does her breath
			  smell of onions?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes, sir.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The millionaire covered his face with his hands for a moment, and then
			  said in a trembling voice:
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Little one, your mother and I once knew each other. You have her
			  voice, her hair, and her eyes. If it had not been for a
			  misunderstanding—perhaps—but that is all past now.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The man unbuttoned his overcoat and took from his vest pocket a
			  package.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Take this,” he said. “I have more than I want. It will last you and
			  your mother a year.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The little girl took the package and ran home in glee.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Oh, see, mama!” she cried. “A gentleman gave me this. He said it
			  would last us a whole year.”
			</p>

			  The pale woman unrolled the package with trembling hands.

			  A certain Houston racing man was married some months ago. He also is
			  the proud possessor of a fine two-year-old filly that has made five
			  and a half furlongs in 1:09 and he expects her to do better at the
			  next races. He has named the filly after his wife and both of them are
			  dear to his heart. A Post man who ran across him yesterday found him
			  quite willing to talk.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Yes,” he said, “I am the happiest man in Texas. Bessie and I are
			  keeping house now and getting quite well settled down. That filly of
			  mine is going to do wonders yet. Bessie takes as much interest in her
			  as I do. You know I have named her for my wife. She is a thoroughbred.

			  break.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “The filly, you mean?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “No, my wife. I took Bessie out driving with the filly yesterday.
			  Bessie’s a daisy. She’s a little high in one shoulder, and a trifle
			  stiff in one leg, but her wind is all right. What do you think of her
			  back?”
			</p>

			<p>
			  “Really, I—I—I never had the pleasure of meeting your wife, but I have

			  “What are you talking about? I mean the filly. The races come off just

			  It will be remembered that a short while ago, some very ancient
			  documents and records were discovered in an old monastery on
			  Mt. Sinai, where they have been kept filed away by the monks among
			  their dusty archives. Some of them antedate the oldest writings
			  previously known by one hundred years. The finders claim that among
			  them are the original Scripture traced in Syriac language, and that
			  they differ in many material ways from the translation in use. We have
			  procured some advance sheets from the discoverers and in a few
			  fragments given below our readers will perceive that human nature was
			  pretty much the same a thousand years ago. It is evident from the
			  palimpsests in our possession that newspapers were not entirely
			  unknown even at that early date. We give some random translations from
			  the original manuscripts:

			  “Commodore Noah, one of our oldest citizens, predicts a big rain soon.
			  The commodore is building an up-to-date houseboat and expects to spend
			  about six weeks afloat with his family and his private menagerie.”
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<p>
			  “Colonel Goliath of Gath, and the new middleweight, Mr. David, are at
			  their old tricks again blowing about the championship. Mr. David has
			  one hand in a sling, but says he will be all right when the affair is
			  pulled off. A little more fighting and less talking would please the
			  readers of the Daily Cymbal.”
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<p>
			  “Ladies, get one of those new fig leaves at the Eden Bazaar before the
			  style is dropped.”
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<p>
			  “The exposition at Shinar is going to be a grand success. Work on the
			  New Woman’s Building called the Tower of Babel has been stopped on
			  account of a misunderstanding. The lady managers have been holding
			  meetings in the Tower for some time.”
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<p>
			  “See Professor Daniel and his performing lions next Sunday.”
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<p>
			  “Colonel Job, who has been suffering from quite a siege of boils at
			  his residence on Avenue C, was arrested yesterday for cussing and
			  disturbing the neighborhood. The colonel has generally a very equable
			  temper, but completely lost his balance on finding that Mrs. Job had
			  put a large quantity of starch in his only night robe.”
			</p>

			<hr/>

			<p>
			  “About 1,500 extra deputy clerks were put on by the county clerk
			  yesterday to assist in getting out summonses for witnesses in the
			  divorce case recently brought by Judge Solomon against the last batch
			  of his wives.”

			  The editor sat in his palatially furnished sanctum bending over a mass
			  of manuscripts, resting his beetling brow upon his hand. It wanted but
			  one hour of the time of going to press and there was that editorial on
			  the Venezuelan question to write. A pale, intellectual youth
			  approached him with a rolled manuscript tied with a pink ribbon.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “It is a little thing,” said the youth, “that I dashed off in an idle
			  moment.”
			</p>

			<p>
			  The editor unrolled the poem and glanced down the long row of verses.
			  He then drew from his pocket a $20 bill and held it toward the poet. A
			  heavy thud was heard, and at the tinkle of an electric bell the
			  editor’s minions entered and carried the lifeless form of the poet
			  away.
			</p>

			<p>
			  “That’s three today,” muttered the great editor as he returned the
			  bill to his pocket. “It works better than a gun or a club and the
			  coroner always brings in a verdict of heart failure.”
